XSLT XSL-FO are W3C Recommendations defining XML document transformation presentation. Use XSLT transform documents XSL-FO printing viewing; also use XSLT general XML-aware programming transformation language, use XSL-FO directly XSLT. typical application be taking groups XML documents PDF: XSL-FO described further page publishing. XSLT? XSL Transformations language transforming XML documents other XML documents, text documents HTML documents. want format chapter book using XSL-FO, want take database query format HTML. XSLT processors operate not only XML anything be made look XML: relational database tables, geographical information systems, file systems, anything XSLT processor build XDM instance. cases XSLT processor also be able work directly database XDM instances. ability operate multiple input files multiple formats, treat were XML files, very powerful. shared XQuery, anything else using XPath Template-Driven Approach XSLT uses template-driven approach transformations: write template shows given input element. example, were formatting letter produce HTML Web, have template match underlined passage make come italics: <template match="underline"> <i> <apply-templates/> </i> </template> Now suppose input document following fragment XML: <underline>really</underline> love XSLT! template match underline element, produce following HTML fragment: <i>really</i> love XSLT! Wildly Popular XSLT become language choice very wide range XML applications. course still used produce XSL-FO documents printing, also used integrate back-end software Web sites. find XSLT most modern Web browsers, so XML be transformed fly user even noticing; find XSLT desktop, servers, network appliances, forming basic dependable part computer infrastructure almost everywhere look. XSLT Used make purchase eBay, buy book Amazon, chances are pretty much everything see Web page been processed XSLT. Use XSLT process multiple XML documents produce combination text, HTML XML output. XSLT support shipped major computer operating systems today, well being built major Web browsers.
