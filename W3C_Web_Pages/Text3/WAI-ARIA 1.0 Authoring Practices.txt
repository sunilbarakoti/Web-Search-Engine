Next, scope include full application, addressing necessary layout structural semantics Web page. semantics are critical enable assistive technologies provide usable experience processing rich internet applications rich documents same page. guidance dynamic document management; use WAI-ARIA Form properties; WAI-ARIA Drag Drop; then creation WAI-ARIA-enabled dialogs. appendix substantial reference information including code samples developers user agents, assistive technologies, Web pages. WAI-ARIA markup currently not included W3C WAI PF working group be creating DTDs XHTML HTML wishing validate markup WAI-ARIA embedded host languages. General Steps Building Accessible Widget WAI-ARIA point have basic understanding WAI-ARIA used support interoperability assistive technologies. are not reusing WAI-ARIA-enabled widget library wish create own following steps guide thought process creating accessible widget using WAI-ARIA. Pick widget type WAI-ARIA taxonomy WAI-ARIA role taxonomy Section constituting most common UI component types. Choose role type provided table. desire was create toolbar set role toolbar: <div role="toolbar"> role, get list supported states properties Once have chosen role widget, consult WAI-ARIA specification in-depth definition role find supported states, properties, other attributes. example, toolbar role definition superclass role taxonomy widget selected inherits states properties role. case toolbar see toolbar subclass group. makes sense given toolbar collection commonly used functions. related concept really more informative state other concepts are similar role. exist different host languages WAI-ARIA. keyboard model control emulate related concept control. supported states properties are unique states properties widget supports were not inherited ancestors taxonomy. case toolbar there are such states properties. However, case listbox, choose set property aria-multiselectable true were have more item listitem selected time. assistive technology listbox collection selectable options. inherited states properties are states properties are inherited roles's ancestors use. global states properties are states properties apply host language components regardless role set not. use well. Once have chosen states properties apply widget set properties use set initial values. Note: do not need use states properties available role. case use: <div role="toolbar" id="customToolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1" onkeydown="return optionKeyEvent(event);" onkeypress="return optionKeyEvent(event);" onblur="hideFocus();" onfocus="showFocus();" > <img src="img/btn1.gif" title="Home" alt="Home" role="button" id="button1" onclick="updateText('Home was invoked');"> <img src="img/btn2.gif" title="Refresh" alt="Refresh" role="button" id="button2" onclick="updateText('Refresh was invoked');"> <img src="img/btn3.gif" title="Help" alt="Help" role="button" id="button3" onclick="updateText('Help was invoked');"> </div> setting tabindex=0 toolbar, toolbar receive focus document order. necessary then use script aria-activedescendant property manage virtual focus buttons. details are given step Important: embedding WAI-ARIA markup HTML, WAI-ARIA states properties be preceded characters aria- exception role tabindex attributes. Otherwise, user agent not map WAI-ARIA information, resulting not being recognized assistive technologies. embedding WAI-ARIA other host languages, tabindex not carry WAI-ARIA tabindex extensions are specific repair deficiencies keyboard support. Establish widget structure markup Assistive technologies are very dependent structure widgets well general document structure. Structure context user. toolbar collection common functions made available user. Therefore, functions toolbar be contained be determined using Document Object Model tree structure created browser parsing host language. using parent child relationship DOM, assistive technology determine related toolbar widgets associated toolbar. toolbar widgets be DOM children container. purposes define image buttons cut, copy, paste. <div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1"> <img src="buttoncut.png" alt="cut" id="button1"> <img src="buttoncopy.png" alt="copy" id="button2"> <img src="buttonpaste.png" alt="paste" id="button3"></div> Repeat steps children parent now need assign roles states children. However, detailed navigation step <div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1"> <img src="buttoncut.png" alt="cut" role="button" id="button1"> <img src="buttoncopy.png" alt="copy" role="button" id="button2"> <img src="buttonpaste.png" alt="paste" role="button" id="button3"></div> process setting roles states be recursive procedure children have children, such case expandable/collapsible tree widget. Establish keyboard navigation widget plan be navigated document very important widget be keyboard accessible. fact, there be keyboard equivalent mouse operation. possible refer WAI-ARIA examples guide tips implement keyboard navigation widget. find example not provided, follow standard keyboard bindings UI components such used Java Foundation Classes Windows 95/NT. toolbar, have chosen have toolbar manage focus children use aria-activedescendant property. have also chosen have toolbar receive focus based tab order using tabindex. order use aria-activedescendant, focusable descendant have assigned ID. <head> <script> â€¦ function optionKeyEvent(event) var tb = event.target; var buttonid; DOM_VK_ENTER = Partial sample code processing arrow keys == return true; Browser use menu view need alt-modified keys XXX Implement circular keyboard navigation toolbar buttons == DOM_VK_ENTER) ExecuteButtonAction(getCurrentButtonID()); author defined function else == event.DOM_VK_RIGHT) Change active toolbar button right var buttonid = getNextButtonID(); author defined function tb.setAttribute("aria-activedescendant", buttonid); else == event.DOM_VK_LEFT) Change active toolbar button left var buttonid = getPrevButtonID(); author defined function tb.setAttribute("aria-activedescendant", buttonid); else return true; return false; else == â€¦ </script><div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1" id="tb1" onkeydown="return optionKeyEvent(event);" onkeypress="return optionKeyEvent(event);"> <img src="buttoncut.png" alt="cut" role="button" id="button1"> <img src="buttoncopy.png" alt="copy" role="button" id="button2"> <img src="buttonpaste.png" alt="paste" role="button" id="button3"></div> details implementing keyboard navigation are described Keyboard Structural Navigation section document. Note: also show visual focus element focus. Apply manage needed WAI-ARIA states response user input events Similar processing aria-activedescendant Step author set additional WAI-ARIA states properties document elements. Synchronize visual UI accessibility states properties supporting user agents consider binding user interface changes directly changes WAI-ARIA states properties, such use CSS attribute selectors. example, setting aria-selected state change background selected treeitem tree. also be done JavaScript. white; background-color: white; background-color: beige;} Authors be aware CSS attribute selectors are not supported browsers, such Internet Explorer consistent way apply styling reflect WAI-ARIA semantics be assign element class name based WAI-ARIA attribute being set using script shown here: function setSelectedOption(menuItem) return; var menu = getMenu(menuItem); var oldMenuItem = getSelectedOption(menu); Set class so show selection appearance oldMenuItem.className="unselected"; menu.setAttribute("aria-activedescendant", menuItem.id); menuItem.className= Showing Hiding Sections Widget proper synchronization showing hiding sections widget WAI-ARIA display state also critical. platform accessibility APIs provide events applications notify assistive technology pop-ups such menus, dialogs come view go away. Rich Internet applications assist browsers support conventions Creating entire section then insert Document Object Model subtree parent element activated show pop-up, then removing section inserted area pop-up away. OR Using following style sheet properties show hide document sections being used represent pop-up items, menus dialogs: display:block display:none visibility:visible visibility:hidden monitoring behaviors user agent use information notify assistive technology pop-up occurred generating appropriate accessibility API event. assistive technologies use DOM directly determine pop-up case, first mechanism writing section DOM work using DOM events demonstrated here. create new table row table cell div	 var newTr = document.createElement('TR');	 var newTd = document.createElement('TD');	 var newDiv = document.createElement('DIV');	 newTr.appendChild(newTd);	 newTd.appendChild(newDiv);	 new table row Node selected	 var container = theNode.parentNode;	 container.insertBefore(newTr, theNode);	 selected	 container.removeChild(theNode);" However, are using CSS show hide sections DOM essential set corresponding WAI-ARIA aria-hidden property indicate section visible hidden synchronize CSS styling shown here: hidden;}â€¦<div role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-owns="mypopupmenu"><div role="menu" aria-hidden="true" id="mypopupmenu">â€¦</div> Support basic accessibility, such alternative text images image used represent information component, such image buttons, need set alternative text images. then mapped user agent accessible name platform accessibility API. Using example: <div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1" id="tb1" onkeydown="return optionKeyEvent(event);" onkeypress="return optionKeyEvent(event);"> <img src="buttoncut" role="button" id="button1" alt="cut"> <img src="buttoncopy" role="button" id="button2" alt="copy"> <img src="buttonpaste" role="button" id="button3" alt="paste"> </div> Establish WAI-ARIA relationships widget others Once have made basic widget accessible then need establish relationship other widgets. Examples are aria-labelledby, aria-controls, aria-describedby aria-flowto. details using relationships are described Relationships section document. Other relationships be considered are more declarative provide context widget set. aria-level, aria-posinset, aria-setsize are provided. structure Document Object Model appropriately so user agent determine information using DOM hierarchy directly, do not need set properties. are, however, situations rich internet applications elements container are not DOM time, such only render items subtree. case user agent determine number tree items position set potentially tree depth DOM. situations need provide WAI-ARIA properties. Review widget ensure have not hard coded sizes ability applications respond system font settings requirement. Most user agents are designed meet requirement. also means Web application running browser impacted user agent changes font sizes meet need. have hard coded font size pixels increase system fonts not be reflected Web application. also not hard code size widgets pixels either. fonts are scalable, widget are encapsulated not, then text flow widget. Follow rules allow application respond system font settings: Establish base set font sizes used widgets based percentage container element font size. Use CSS width, borders, margin, padding, background, positioning properties specify graphical rendering widgets sub-components, use percentage units em units specify widths widget components em font unit measure top bottom upper case letter M.). Border widths, padding, margins use PX units. Use scripting run time CSS positioning widget sub-components relation other sub components. Make sure widgets use consistent height width units measure. Percentages are most reliable way consistently specify proportional text sizes widgets. use percentages em be used specifying widths widget widget sub components. use percentages text size percentages em units widths support browser zoom capabilities make widgets larger smaller.Pixels be used specifying line widths, padding margins. Important: Most browsers today have zoom feature allow user magnify entire Web page. Most legislation today application respond system font color settings therefore want consider fact system settings adversely affect Web page decide hard code pixel sizes. Compensate Background Images High Contrast Mode Authors use background images styling widgets, including situations background image not merely decorative, informative. example horizontal progress bar filled gradually revealing more background image. accomplished initially setting width element then incrementing width accordance degree progress. High contrast mode operating system display modification makes screen easier see low vision users. operating systems Windows), do not display background images high contrast mode. Consequently, progress bar described empty regardless progress. recommended authors not use background images sole method convey important information, compensate alternative additional style rules. case progress bar example, technique works high contrast mode style element border. width element updated progress increases, border gradually expands horizontally forming ever wider unfilled rectangle. alternative visual feedback extent progress. technique replace background image text. Consider dialog uses background image close box. compensate missing close box high contrast mode, lower case used instead. compensation technique used context, particularly purpose background image. are general approaches respect detecting high contrast mode. are executing script determine system high contrast mode, providing preference use alternative styles. advantage automatic detection operating systems simply apply different color palette high contrast mode do not turn background images. case, authors need not compensate missing background images. However, detection high contrast mode script relatively expensive compared preference users set, presumably, users see background images are displayed high contrast mode system. up individual authors decide method find acceptable particular situation. following code fragment detect high contrast mode. Define styles high contrast test element border: 1px solid; border-color:red green; position: absolute; height: 5px; top: background-image: url('resources/blank.gif');}â€¦// onload event handler inserts high contrast test element then tests computed styles.function detectHiContrast() var div = document.createElement('div'); div.setAttribute â€¦ <div#hiContrastTestEl> <body> element â€¦ var cs = window.getComputedStyle(div); var bki = cs.backgroundImage; var hiContrast = false; CSS sets top right borders test element red green, respectively. high contrast mode borders are same colour, there legitimate url background image. hiContrast = == cs.borderRightColor) null == bki == apply contrast styles compensate missing background images. â€¦ remove test element document â€¦} Test User agent, Assistive Technology, People disabilities ensure have set WAI-ARIA semantics correctly, test application user agent, assistive technology, person disability. Example assistive technologies are screen readers screen magnifiers. Ensure user agent designed support WAI-ARIA assistive technology designed support WAI-ARIA selected user agent. Finding people disabilities do testing be difficult many companies employ people disabilities, including customers, reach ask help. Other places look are advocacy groups National Federation Blind local schools blind, reading learning centers, so people reach someday need use produce. Keyboard Structural Navigation Providing effective navigation experience user critical usability. section starts guidance provide effective keyboard navigation widgets Rich Internet Application environment. discussion manage keyboard focus specifics providing keyboard navigation tooltips. followed broader discussion convey structural semantics entire Web page. semantics help assistive technology provide additional navigation, increase user productivity, render page alternative formats. rendering be different forms, including not limited speech, page restructuring, alternative input solutions. Providing Keyboard Navigation Widgets WAI-ARIA Keyboard Bindings Behaviors Essential accessible Web widgets keyboard support provide full operation functionality widget keyboard-only events. traditional HTML form controls, Web widgets, typically, have inherent keyboard support. developer enable keyboard support widgets create use widget libraries keyboard support. model keyboard support Web widgets are graphical user interface operating systems Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X; other desktop operating systems GNOME GTK. Basic accessibility requirements keyboard focus include: Support users use pointing devices due physical visual impairment access full functionality Web application. major software Web accessibility guidelines people disabilities require keyboard-only operation interface accessibility. Communicate accessibility information assistive technologies type widget associated state properties. example, screen reader user tree announced, know pressing right arrow key expand node. Similarly, hear grid announced, know use screen reader's table reading commands. Keyboard Navigation Widgets tabindex attribute focus be moved keyboard HTML elements. standard HTML tabindex was limited form anchor elements. WAI-ARIA, tabindex attribute now applicable renderable HTML elements additional functionality designed help author produce keyboard accessible Web widgets. Tab Shift+Tab key move focus widgets standard HTML controls. Widgets tabindex=0 be added tab sequence based document order Widgets tabindex>0 be added tab sequence based TABINDEX value Widgets tabindex<0 not be added tab sequence are enabled receive keyboard focus. Once widget keyboard focus, arrow keys, Space, Enter key, other keyboard commands be used navigate options widget, change state, trigger application function associated widget. Keyboard Navigation Widgets element keyboard focus needs have tabindex attribute set current active descendant element active descendant not exist. element keyboard focus essential information widget assistive technologies screen readers magnifiers operating specific accessibility APIs Microsoft Active Accessibility Apple AX APIs, ATK Accessibility Toolkit. TAB key moves keyboard focus widget, other keys operate features widget, typically cursor keys, Enter key Space. actual keys are up developer, best practices recommend using same key bindings are used control similar widgets common GUI operating systems Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X other desktop operating systems GNOME GTK. JavaScript use focus() method move focus appropriate element widget, use WAI-ARIA property called aria-activedescendant actual widget container indicate element widget have focus. following procedure be followed focus completely dependent use tabindex provide focus widget: Set tabindex="0" current active descendant widget setting tabindex="-1" other child elements widget user arrows) away item, old item tabindex="-1" new item tabindex="0". Use javascript method set focus, using JavaScript focus() method, item tabindex="-1" procedure roving tabindex. tab away tab back widget, same last active descendant active again. author having compute set focus last activedescendant. Conversely, use WAI-ARI aria-activedescendant property things get lot easier: Set tabindex="0" element composite widget, set activedescendant property id child wish be active, user arrows) away item widget, refresh activedescendant property containing widget id new active descendant child. browser then be responsible managing focus changes greater detail, see Using Tabindex Manage Focus Widgets. scenarios author indicate styling markup element widget focus Keyboard Shortcuts Widgets useful provide keyboard access widgets, focus widget directly activate features widget. be use letter label control, well other special keys perform familiar operations system. providing non-standard key commands, document so user use localizing user interface, be necessary localize keyboard mnemonics well order keep apparent. Be sure not introduce key conflicts doing ensure correct key commands remain apparent user. Example Keyboard Operation: Radio Group/Radio See working Radio button examples University Illinois. Key Bindings Radio Group Behavior Example Key Description Radio Group Behavior Tab Key radio button checked, focus moves first radio button group, radio button remains unchecked. radio button checked, focus moves checked radio button. SHIFT+TAB pressed, focus moves last radio button group, radio button remains unchecked. Space Bar Checks radio button keyboard focus special case using tab radio buttons have been marked checked). Down Arrow button checked, check first radio button. last radio button checked, check first radio button. Otherwise, move check current radio button radio button. Arrow button checked, check last radio button. first radio button checked, check last radio button. Otherwise, move check current radio button previous radio button. Radio Group example, tabindex first last radio button elements tabindex="0" none radio buttons checked), remaining radio elements have tabindex="-1". soon first last radio button focus changes tabindex value other radio button none radio buttons selected keyboard focus leaves group first last radio buttons have tabindex values set Other Widget Authoring Practices Common Widget Design Patterns section document best practices, such keyboard navigation, creating common widgets found Web. section miscellaneous authoring practices also consider. Maintain valid format aria-valuenow essential application vendors maintain valid format foraria-valuenow, aria-valuenow shouldaccurately represent value widget.The value be range aria-valuemin aria-valuemin, value aria-valuemin less equal value aria-valuemax, life cycle widget. aria-valuemin not less equal value aria-valuemax, aria-valuemax indeterminate, error condition be handled assistive technology, resulting undesirable results. alternative text equivalent be needed properly represent aria-valuenow, such day week, then accompany aria-valuenow appropriate aria-valuetext equivalent such example: <div role="slider" aria-valuenow="1" 	aria-valuemin="1" aria-valuemax="7"	aria-valuetext="Sunday"> Here values represent days week aria-valuenow equivalent first day week Sunday. aria-valuetext made available aria-valuenow also be treated index based. Providing Keyboard Focus way provide keyboard support form list elements accept keyboard focus default. Tab key, user navigate types elements. However, building sophisticated widgets, necessary be able control keyboard navigation exactly. Authors require prefer use host language elements do not have built-in keyboard navigation features. example, author wish provide keyboard navigation altering tab order. Navigating large composite widgets such tree views, menubars, spreadsheets be very tedious inconsistent users are familiar desktop counterparts. solution provide full keyboard support using arrow keys provide more intuitive navigation widget, allowing Tab Shift+Tab move focus widget place tab order. tenet keyboard accessibility reliable, persistent indication focus. author responsible, scripts, maintaining visual programmatic focus observing accessible behavior rules. Screen readers keyboard-only users rely focus operate rich internet applications keyboard. Using Tabindex Manage Focus Widgets requirement supporting keyboard allow focus be set element. tabindex attribute be used include additional elements tab order set programmatic focus Originally implemented Internet Explorer feature been extended Opera, Gecko-based user agents such Firefox, WebKit-based user agents such Safari. following table use tabindex attribute: Use Tabindex Attribute Tabindex Attribute Focusable mouse JavaScript element.focus() Tab Navigation not present Follows default behavior element form controls anchors receive focus.) Follows default behavior element tabindex="0" yes tab order relative element's position document Positive tabindex="X" X positive integer yes Tabindex value directly element positioned tab order. Negative tabindex="-1" yes author focus element.focus() result arrow other key press Setting tabindex value element element receive focus JavaScript using element.focus() method. method used enable arrow key navigation elements. element be navigated arrow keys have tabindex enable receive focus. Here are just few additional tips help managing keyboard focus: Use focus blur events event delegation) monitor changes current focus focus blur events now be used element. Modern browsers now support activeElement property document object get focused element. Don't assume focus changes come key mouse events, assistive technologies such screen readers set focus focusable element, needs be handled elegantly JavaScript widget. Techniques such delegation" example, intercepting events list rather listitem) greatly increase web application performance code maintainability, authors are encouraged use JavaScript best practices possible. Note: activeElement property now standard HTML Follow keydowns move focus keydown event handler determine object receive focus call element's focus() method. Use onkeydown trap key events, not onkeypress Key press events do not fire keys vary browsers. Dynamically change focusability using tabIndex property want update tabindex values custom control disabled enabled. Disabled controls not be tab order. However, typically arrow part grouped navigation widget. element focus, change tabindex value make element default element widget. important user leaves widget returns widget again so focus last element widget user was other elements widget receive keyboard focus, only element widget have tabindex value Use element.focus() set focus Do not use createEvent(), initEvent() dispatchEvent() send focus element, functions do not change focus. DOM focus events are informational only, generated user agent element acquired focus, not used set focus. use pseudo-class selectors style keyboard focus not supported many versions Internet Explorer. Authors use pseudo-class older versions IE treat conjunction pseudo-class. Example: text-decoration: underline; related CSS pseudo-classes are not appropriate not supported browsers, authors use JavaScript techniques indicate appropriate focus alternative, such using focus blur events toggle classname element. Always draw focus tabindex="-1" items elements receive focus programmatically supporting versions Internet Explorer older Choose changing background color something = add dotted border = dotted invert". dotted border case, need make sure elements have invisible 1px border start so element grow border style applied take up space, IE implement CSS Prevent used key events performing browser functions key such arrow key used, prevent browser using key do something scrolling) using code following: <span tabindex="-1" onkeypress="return handleKeyPress();"> handleKeyDown() returns false, event be consumed, preventing browser performing action based keystroke. addition return value browser call event methods prevent default action, IE setting event property other browsers supporting W3C event model means calling method event object. <span tabindex="-1" onkeydown="return handleKeyDown();"> handleKeyDown() returns false, event be consumed, preventing browser performing action based keystroke. Use key event handlers enable activation element mouse event handler, keyboard event handler required. example, have onclick="doSomething()" also need onkeydown="return event.keyCodeÂ doSomething();" order allow Enter key activate element. Note: are user agent-specific considerations key event handling. Consider using tabindex complex widgets are not using aria-activedescendant property. Using activedescendant Manage Focus Widget Children addition tabindex, WAI-ARIA aria-activedescendant property managing focus child elements widget. Widgets grid tree typically manage children. root element widget have tabindex value greater equal ensure widget document tabbing order. Rather setting key event handler element larger component, event handler be set parent element such tree. then job parent element manage focus children. parent use aria-activedescendant property indicate active child. example, container element role tree provide onkeydown event handler so individual tree item tree not need be focusable listen keydown event. container object, case tree, needs maintain point regard manage individual child item be perceived active. Important: given container widget activedescendant cause focus events be fired ATs, actual focus be container widget HTML done putting tabindex="0" container widget. key handler parent captures keystrokes item active updates aria-activedescendant property ID appropriate, active child element. browser ID information focus event assistive technology. individual element not have be made focusable tabindex value be styled using CSS indicate active status. active status moved descendant, ensure scrolled view using scrollIntoView(). See section Managing Focus Scroll more information. Managing Visual Focus tabindex Alone alternative using activedescendant have parent element, response same keyboard input, move focus children first removing tabindex children do not have focus, tab order. be followed setting tabindex element receive focus then using script set focus element receive focus. aria-activedescendant, managed children tabbing order. browsers do not yet support aria-activedescendant maintain keyboard navigation, notification many assistive technologies screen magnifiers move visual focus relying other WAI-ARIA properties. Today, technique work most user agents, long run aria-activedescendant require less work developer. not always ideal based widget are creating, benefit using tabindex manage focus element user agent scroll element view focus set not case aria-activedescendant. setting updating aria-activedescendant property, e.g. aria-activedescendant="cell23", authors ensure element id="cell23" view. case, consider positioning widget visible area browser maximize usability. be achieved using available JavaScript scrolling functions. Managing Focus Scroll browsers, JavaScript call scrollIntoView() element suffice, browsers unreliable, authors explicitly set scrollTop scrollLeft properties element ancestors scroll element view. scrollTop scrollLeft adjust node positions amounts(pixels) needed scroll node view. Â Scrolling values are adjusted amounts(pixels) needed scroll node view. done comparing sizes nodes using available measurements such scroll+offset+clientWidth/Height/Left/Top. important note have adjust node so viewable context parent node. Â Then have move up DOM tree make parent node visible. example, create custom scrollIntoView() method called various times, including coincidence setting aria-activedescendant property. method DOM node argument, say Here high level algorithm: n already view, stop; otherwise, continue. adjust n.scrollTop n.scrollLeft such view. adjust scrollTop scrollLeft ancestor nodes n such region ancestors n visible. minimum-position-change algorithm. Understanding DOM scrollIntoView works browsers important. Browsers Firefox3) force node top bottom screen defined single Boolean parameter) even already view. problematic only need scroll horizontally see element. also problematic node partially bottom screen parameter forces node way top, vice versa top going bottom IE forces node left client area right right-to-left mode) even horizontally view already. scrollTop scrollLeft functions create challenges. scrollTop always accurate misleading respect inner scrollbars. scrollLeft be relied right-to-left languages sometimes negative sometimes positive especially respect inner scrollbars. Different browsers handle right-to-left completely differently. Managing Perception Dual Focus Often applications give perception having dual focus. examples are multi-selection list boxes selected tabs, tablist, focus tabpanel. case muti-selection list box developer gray selected items move focus list box items toggle selected state. case tabpanel user tab then focused item corresponding tabpanel tab also have focus. reality, only element have focus application. scenarios authors ensure keyboard focus set current element visibly keyboard user input ensuring other elements have aria-selected state de-selected. de-selection such multi-select item de-selected user moves new tab de-select old tab, author ensure visible selection de-selected item removed. Author-Defined Keyboard Short-Cuts Mnemonics Author-defined keyboard short-cuts mnemonics present high risk assistive technology users. are device-, browser-, AT-dependent, conflicts key bindings are highly probable. Therefore, needed use accesskey, be aware behave differently different browsers. also not work small devices so still advisable ensure features are accessible basic keys Tab/Shift+Tab, arrow, Enter, Space Escape. XHTML Working Group currently developing new Access Module address issue hope have feature future versions Refer Section Implementation Guidance. Supporting Tooltips Keyboard tooltip popup messages typically triggered moving mouse control widget causing small popup window appear additional information control. provide simple text tooltips, HTML title attribute more suffice user agent render tooltips. creating tooltip, essential user be able activate using keyboard. form control widget keyboard focus, tooltip display. form control widget focus, tooltip disappear. Browsers do not currently support functionality. following code snippet iCITA site shows use onfocus="tooltipShow();" function display tooltip focus placed element. <html lang="en-us""> <head> <title>inline: Tooltip Example <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tooltip1_inline.css" type="text/css"> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/tooltip1_inline.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/widgets_inline.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/globals.js"></script> <link rel="icon" href="http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"> <link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"> </head> â€¦ <body onload="initApp()"> <div id="container"> <h1>Tooltip Example <h2>Create Account</h2> <div class="text"> <label Name:</label> <input type="text" id="first" name="first" size="20" onmouseover="tooltipShow(event, onfocus="tooltipShow(event, aria-describedby="tp1" aria-required="false"/> <div id="tp1" role="tooltip" aria-hidden="true">Your first name optional. </div> </div> â€¦ Keyboard Handlers Shortcuts Steal Keys Similar tip specified Using Tabindex Manage Focus Widgets, web application cancel swallow) keyboard event keyboard handler prevent key being used web application. example user presses Control+PageDown tab panel web application, keyboard event not also go user agent, cycle active browser tab, confusing user. Providing Navigable Structure Web Pages section broader look Web page. intended assist conveying logical, usable, accessible layout assistive technology adaptive system designed modify visual layout meet users needs. deficiencies disabled users been usability keyboard navigation. Users dependent keyboard navigation have been forced tab everywhere document, only keyboard accessible document elements are form anchor elements. forced developers make most everything link make keyboard accessible, get link have tab advent portals other content aggregation means Web pages are divided visible regions there been vehicle get other perhaps do things such Create skip link top page main content Make head perceivable region bar, stock quote, TV Listing, etc.) <H1> tag are number problems approach: force user interface change support accessibility case using <H1> mark regions, not consistent Web sites semantics are limited main content section convey need rich internet application developer control keyboard navigation assistive technology remainder section author playbook using WAI-ARIA add semantically rich navigation structure Web page so assistive technology provide effective user experience avoid shortcomings.

Sight mobility impaired users be able quickly access list landmarks web page, be used table contents. user quickly navigate important sections page TAB navigation. not done, then content be orphaned missed user. fact many today's accessibility test tools have built-in rules flag issue compliance error. section create navigable regions page: Identify logical structure page Break up page perceivable block areas contain semantically associated information called further break down region logical regions needed. common process undertaken portal developers break page perceivable regions called portlets. Think user wanting navigate logical block areas Web page. Write down description believe region be. Depending Web application then need break sub regions depending complexity Web application. recursive process. user look perceivable areas pealing onion. have outermost collection perceivable regions block areas entering region have collection regions Implement logical structure markup Implementing block structure markup often wrapping elements contained such <div> <iframe> visible borders so region block perceivable user. Label region Once have broken up region need label start region have perceivable header be used label region. details do see section Header Levels nesting level create header label region. finding difficult come up label region, make sure least use standard roles defined following step. drawback not providing label users not know purpose region. definition, regions be included summary page. assistive technology were summarize be unable provide information section label. Assign landmark roles region Now labeled regions, need assign semantic navigation landmarks. Landmarks are vast improvement rudimentary main content" technique employed prior WAI-ARIA. possible best use landmarks. Skip main content links impact placement web application elements. be consideration developers want try keep web application specific visible area. Consequently, layout adjustments need be made support skip main content links. Also, skip main content links are limited only address only main content area. WAI-ARIA collection landmarks are applied regions identified step presence common, semantic, navigation landmarks site support same standard assistive technology provide consistent navigation experience important feature screen readers alternate input solutions. users cognitive learning disabilities landmark information be used expand collapse regions page aid simplifying user experience allowing user manage amount information processed time. WAI-ARIA landmark roles are applied elements having strong native semantics are not mapped consistently platform accessibility API. example TABLE element. reason, recommended authors apply landmarks DIV SPAN containers. are also mainstream benefits providing navigation landmarks. browser assign key sequences move focus sections be set site. Navigation landmarks device independent. personal digital assistant assign device key get document. common landmarks WAI-ARIA include: application region page representing unique software unit executing set tasks users. area assistive technologies also return browse navigation keys back web application region. entire web page role application then not be treated navigational landmark assistive technology. banner region prime heading internal title page. complementary section document supports separable main content, meaningful own even separated contentinfo Meta information first immediate ancestor role not presentation. form region document collection form-associated elements, represent editable values be submitted server processing. main Main content document. navigation collection links suitable use navigating document related documents. search search tool Web document. set landmark page: <div role="navigation" title="Table Contents"> â€¦ </div> <div role="main" title="Game Statistics"> â€¦ </div> application landmarks static prose have regional landmark type application static descriptive text available, then application landmark, include aria-describedby reference associate application static text shown here: <div role="applicaton" aria-labelledby="calendar" aria-describedby="info"><h1 id="calendar">Calendar<h1><p id="info">This calendar shows game schedule Boston Red Sox.</p><div role="grid">â€¦</div> landmarks unsuited specialized region WAI-ARIA roles create custom regional landmarks using generic region. not essential label specialized regions header, provide title ensure region name accessible users, just standard regional landmarks. See Header levels Nesting levels directions label region. <div role="main"> â€¦ <div role="region" title="weather"> Note: region role generic only be used more specific role not applicable. Indicate assistive technology controls keyboard navigation Today's screen readers blind have been designed give user experience meaning screen reader number keys aid browsing experience. example, arrow keys are used read previous line text Web page. Accessible rich internet applications use keys application navigate Tree View. Assistive technologies be able identify widgets implement WAI-ARIA allow use keyboard. However, have used numerous widgets form application set role encompassing region application. have regions be browsed documents application region mark regions document role needed. See section Structural Roles used facilitate assistive technology navigation. Structural Roles Facilitate Navigation Assistive Technologies WAI-ARIA designed address many disabilities, section best described terms screen reader use. desktop applications, screen readers typically treat widgets discrete entities, reading interacting widget time. user moves point focus widget widget using tab/shift tab, mnemonics, accelerators, keyboard commands are usually provided application operating system. refer mode interaction mode." viewing Web content however, screen readers often gather information widgets area present document-like view user using keyboard commands provided controlled screen reader. Think mode virtual environment presents Web content way makes convenient adaptive technology users navigate read. sometimes called browse mode, virtual mode. refer browse mode." many screen readers provide document mode navigation support using single key mnemonics alpha-numeric keyboard, provide third mode, called mode," used interact form controls are encountered document mode. Behavior forms mode similar application mode. key feature forms mode be toggled document mode make easy interact specific widget, read virtualized content widget part. described above, screen reader's perception area document application greatly influences user WAI-ARIA content authors way indicate pages be viewed applications documents assistive technologies. set document application mode follow steps: Set Application Role have divided Web page regions use role landmarks custom regions, make decision: Web page application not? majority content application-like default interaction mode be set application, document regions embedded application applicable. Otherwise default interaction mode document-like therefore not be overridden use global role application. case application role be placed discrete regions document applicable. set role application body tag <body role="application"> using application, static text be associated widgets, groups panes using aria-labelledby aria-describedby properties, otherwise not be read screen reader user related widget group. Special Considerations: have selected have role application body tag, recommended widget have focus page first loaded. be instance application needs receive focus, such application consisting solely scrollable editable text area. page loads have focus widget strong indicator Web page have role application. page only few isolated widgets, pop-up calendars located Web page, not necessary expressly set role application body. Screen readers, based widget roles, be able provide access widgets recognizing entire page application. Also, browsers make use feature called contenteditable attribute, be incorporated HTML Contenteditable author turn browser section rich text editor, similar word processor. section contenteditable set considered widget. body element been given role application, please follow step Otherwise, Web page considered document, further action required regard. Dialogs alert dialogs special case application roles WAI-ARIA dialog alertdialog roles are be treated special case application roles. application, screen readers leave main job keyboard navigation up dialog. using dialog, static text be associated widgets, groups panes using aria-labelledby aria-describedby properties, otherwise not be read screen reader user related widget group. application, Web page unlikely start roles rather author most likely dynamically create dialogs alertdialog sections Web page. dialog, descriptive text alert not need be associated relationship, contents alert dialogs be read automatically screen reader dialog Set document role default mode screen reader be processing HTML Web page document browse mode. equivalent having role document HTML <body> tag. have already specified role application body tag there be times tell screen reader switch browse mode" start stealing necessary keys browse document section Web page. keys are typical keys used WAI-ARIA widgets provide level navigation keys be stolen browser. mark areas page tell assistive technology switch document browse mode, look regions/landmarks have defined determine ones be browsed document navigated application. region be browsed document browse mode, embed div element role document <div role="document"> Now, screen reader encounters region, change interaction model document browsing mode. Implicit Nesting Headings section use heading role nesting levels. Header Levels Versus Nesting Levels heading role value heading section document instance. Use heading role specific object header. region document heading pertains be marked aria-labelledby property containing value id header. have heading there element containing content heads, wrap content <div> bearing aria-labelledby attribute. headings are organized logical outline, aria-level property be used indicate nesting level. Here example ARIA. Note preferred way using native semantics ARIA, approach ARIA shown first demonstrate use heading role: Using ARIA:<div role="main" aria-labelledby="page_title"> <p id="page_title" role="heading" aria-level="1">Top News Stories</p> â€¦ main page contents here â€¦</div>Using native markup:<div role="main" aria-labelledby="page_title"> <h1 id="page_title">Top News Stories</h1> â€¦ main page contents here â€¦</div> Repairs Nesting Assistive technology briefs users context are. arrive new page, page summary be given. move new context, labeling elements containing new focus reading location be rendered assistive technology, give context details be read next. syntactic structure page default nesting contexts. paragraph nested <div> table cell, assumed labels <div> headers table cell are pertinent paragraph. other hand, not possible always flow logical structure one-to-one parse structure. aria-owns relationship provided annotate logical nesting logical child not syntactic descendant logical parent. Rich Internet Application, updates be made document updating logical syntactic structure, yet elements appear be added document structure. DOM accessibility hierarchy perspective aria-owns fallback mechanism using tree hierarchy provided DOM. example aria-owns needed treeitem, children folder subtree are added visible subtree not reflected actual document subtree folder. aria-owns relationship be used associate folder new child. more details use aria-owns see section Owning Controlling. aria-owns relationship used indicate user agent menu adopting parent sub menu. use aria-owns hierarchical diagram child nodes diagram are not be adequately represented using DOM structure. Directories, Groups, Regions are several WAI-ARIA roles used indicate collection user interface objects, distinct purpose: directory static table contents group Small set related user interface objects not be included page summary table contents assistive technology region Section related user interface objects be included page summary table contents. use described Directories Applicability WAI-ARIA role, directory, authors mark static table content sections document. Prior WAI-ARIA, user need guess area document actually pertained table contents. Authors mark sections document role directory. <div role="directory"> <ul> <li>Global Warming Causes <ul> <li>CO2 Buildup</li> <li>Auto emissions<li> <li>Factory emissions</li> <li>Destruction rainforests</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tailoring CO2 buildup <ul> <li>Elimination incandescent light bulb</li> <li>Hydrogen fuel cells</li> <li>Solar energy</li> <li>Wind power</li> </ul> </li> </ul></div> Groups Applicability Authors use role group form logical collections items related functionality widget. group not be considered major perceivable section page. group heading Contents." group delineate set treeitems having same level tree be used group set related checkboxes form. Other examples include: row grid row specialized group representing row grid); group children tree widget forming collection siblings hierarchy; group items having same container directory Proper handling group assistive technologies, therefore, determined context provided. Group members are DOM subtree group need have explicit relationships assigned order participate group. Groups also be nested. author section significant enough terms entire document instance, then author assign section role region designated standard landmarks. designated landmark roles are listed section Regions XHTML Role landmarks. Regions Use defining region section document, authors consider using standard document landmark roles defined XHTML Vocabulary. makes possible user agents assistive technologies treat roles standard navigation landmarks. definition regions inadequate, authors use WAI-ARIA region role provide appropriate title text. more information use region see Regions XHTML Role landmarks. Â Remaining Structural Roles columnheader directory grid gridcell img list listitem row rowheader separator treegrid Tabular Structure-Related Roles Supporting Tabular Widgets number structural roles support tabular widgets, grid treegrid. structural roles indicate additional keyboard navigation well ability select rows columns. Typically, apply roles underlying table base markup shown here: <table role="grid">		 However, not work developer instances, such developer need <div> <span> additional semantics are needed. assist, following roles are provided support tabular widgets: columnheader grid gridcell row rowheader treegrid constructing gridor treegrid author use gridcells actual cells: <table role="grid"> <tr> <td role= role= </tr> <tr> <td role="gridcell">Macintosh</td><td role="gridcell">Valencia</td> </tr></table> table cells table, authors ensure grid's gridcells are focusable use tabindex HTML), aria-activedescendant grid.They also be editable, shown example. Treegrid's require expanding collapsing rows not be performed using <tr>. instances authors use HTML <div>. WAI-ARIA role row be assigned <div> convey assistive technology still row. decide not use native HTML <table> elements choose more flexible elements, such <div> <span>s, applied WAI-ARIA roles section, structurally lay elements line expect HTML. rowheaders be row gridcells be children subsequent row same format HTML <td>s <th>s <tr>s. Marking Descriptive Sections new feature WAI-ARIA ability associate descriptive text section, drawing, form element, picture, so using aria-describedby property. use case aria-describedby reference local id long description. most common use case longdesc author create separate file describe picture. prefereable have descriptive text prose well so readily available users. useful authors do not want create separate document description, cognitively impaired users be confused context changes having go page description. Yet, longdesc, descriptive text treated separately short name provided title alt attributes HTML. aria-describedby property text hidden elements be used accessible descriptions. screen reader vendors have used non-standard attributes provide hidden help text form elements. order standardize feature, hidden text exposed description property Accessibility API objects referenced aria-describedby. <img src="foo" alt="abbreviated name" aria-describedby="prose1"><div id="prose1"> prose div image foo detail.</div> preferred vehicle providing long descriptions elements document. author not desire entire descriptive text be located main page, aria-describedby also be used point link page. <div id="figuretitle">Figure Entity Relationship Diagram showing EMP DEPT</div> <img src="foo" aria-labelledby="figuretitle" aria-describedby="link1"> <a href="descriptionLocation.html" id="link1">Description Figure Entity Relationship Diagram showing EMP DEPT</a></div> not good practice use pattern describing elementâ€”the <a> tag @id='link1'â€”is hidden, there way user navigate activate link. Use technique only description not hidden. Miscellaneous XHTML Section Roles order synchronize XHTML Role Attribute module, WAI-ARIA XHTML roles are landmarks widgets kind. roles were incorporated replace standard elements found host languages. roles are definition note. role corresponding element host language, recommended authors use corresponding element host language. definition role definition statement document. HTML developers implementing lists definitions, recommend using DL, DT, DD elements rather marking arbitrary element role definition. arbitrary element be appropriate inline definitions used conjunction DFN element. Example inline definition explicit labelledby relationship: <p>The doctor explained had been <dfn id="placebo">placebo</dfn>, <span role="definition" aria-labelledby="placebo"> inert preparation prescribed more mental relief patient actual effect disorder.</span></p> Example inline definition implicit labelledby relationship determined nesting: <p>The doctor explained had been <span role="definition"><dfn>placebo</dfn>, inert preparation prescribed more mental relief patient actual effect disorder.</span></p> Note: case host language semantics do not allow implicit nesting definitions terms definition roles, authors explicitly use aria-labelledby attribute, even definition term nested definition shown here: <p>The doctor explained had been <span role="definition" aria-labelledby="placebo"><dfn id="placebo">placebo</dfn>, inert preparation prescribed more mental relief patient actual effect disorder.</span></p> following example using definition list: <dl> <dt id="anathema">anthema</dt> <dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="anathema">a ban curse solemnly pronounced ecclesiastical authority accompanied excommunication</dd> <dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="anathema">a vigorous denunciation cursor</dd><dt id="homily">homily</dt><dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="homily">a usually short sermon</dd> <dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="homily">a lecture discourse moral theme</dd></dl> note role parenthetic ancillary remark main content resource. also assistive technologies skip section document more information requested main content. <div role="main" aria-labelledby="foo"> <h1 id="foo">Wild fires spread San Diego Hills</h1> Strong winds expand fires ignited high temperatures â€¦</div><div role="note"> article was last updated July </div> Making Dialog Modal WAI-ARIA dialog roles dialog alertdialog. authors simulate dialogs web page often limit interaction considerations mouse. Graphical User Interface dialog boxes desktop computer, user keyboard navigation accidentally navigate dialog box become disoriented. happen user tabbing dialog. modal dialog user setting focus dialog dialog closed. Mouse clicks dialog be ignored user not be able tab dialog WAI-ARIA enabled dialog boxes be modal. section Mouse clicks dialog be prevented creating CSS positioned element size viewport child body element.

Trapping Focus onkeypress handler catch key presses document. onkeypress event handler be scope dialog box code so access first last tab focusable elements dialog. onkeypress handler determine target keypress event. addition, determine there only single focusable item dialog box. instance first tab navigable object equal last tab navigable object. key presses dialog box create, destroy, enable, disable, change visibility tab focusable elements, then determine first last tab-focusable items time keypress received. Based event target key pressed take following actions: keypress Shift+Tab key target == first tab navigable object, then set focus last tab-navigable object stop key press event. there only single tab focusable item, then focus not have be set, key press event be stopped. keypress Tab key target == last tab navigable object, then set focus first tab-navigable object stop keypress event. there only single tab-focusable item, then focus not have be set keypress event be stopped. keypress Escape key target node container node dialog box, then close dialog box hide destroy dialog underlay. Determine target node keypress dialog box container. be done using loop walk parent chain target node container node dialog box found. Other outlined above, key presses dialog box be allowed execute so user interact controls dialog box. target node not dialog box, keypress documentElement keypress event be stopped Tab key press.

WAI-ARIA aria-labelledby aria-describedby attributes signal browser feed relationships accessibility layer. layer then used screen readers other accessibility technology gain awareness disparate regions are actually contextually connected other. awareness then present meaningful navigation model discovery presentation additional content sections. user agent also choose present insights meaningful way. Generally always add attributes widgets site are often merely construct HTML JavaScript obvious insight widget's behavior interactivity Labeling using element label use aria-labelledby attribute. label provide user essence object example, have dialog box erected HTML <div> need assocate label dialog. WAI-ARIA role dialog, indicate widget type define label using HTML header then associate label dialog using aria-labelledby relationship. 	<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialogheader">	<h2 id="dialogheader">Choose File</h2>	â€¦ Dialog contents	</div>	 section doing labeling be referenced multiple widgets objects need only reference same id, so contextual description not always be viable. labelledby attribute have multiple ids specified space separated list much applying multiple classes single DOM object. aria-labelledby property be used label visual objects, however be noted @for attribute label element used label form controls. Use attribute possible valid. aria-labelledby attribute multiple IDREFs, recommended authors use aria-labelledby labeling elements require more label string. elements receive label embedded text content, exception. Often user agents operate images turned network performance reasons. situations, alt text provided place image. host language alternative text capability recommended authors use alternative text support situations not use separate labeling replacement. Describing Using aria-describedby element use aria-describedby attribute. aria-describedby section further information given object widget, not be intuitively obvious context, content other attributes. example, fake window common widget used Web applications often constructed using div absolute positioned layer other content. simulate common window behavior look feel there often X box corner activated, window widget. common way make X box simply make link content X. give non-visual user much go belies real purpose X link. help add more descriptive text stored elsewhere page <button aria-label="Close" aria-describedby="descriptionClose" onclick="myDialog.close();">X</button> then elsewhere HTML <div id="descriptionClose">Closing window discard information entered return back main page</div> labelledby, describedby accept multiple ids point other regions page using space separated list. also limited ids defining sets. contrived example also want good labelledby section fully explain window closing effect task being worked object widget describedby user agent try extract information label tags, present. label tags have limited use only be applied forms tables, respectively. Using tooltip description WAI-ARIA also tooltip role aria-describedby reference author defined tooltip. assistive technology tell type object describing document element purpose element example, screen reader announce tooltip user having wave mouse element following describedby relationship document area tooltip role. aria-describedby property also useful describing groups. Here code snippet showing set tooltip: â€¦ <div class="text"> <label Name:</label> <input type="text" id="first" name="first" size="20" onfocus="tooltipShow(tooltip1);" onblur="tooltipHide(tooltip1);" onmouseover="tooltipShow(tooltip1);" onmouseout="tooltipHide(tooltip1);" aria-describedby="tp1" <div id="tp1" class="tooltip" role="tooltip">Your first name optional</div> </div> â€¦ Descriptions external pages aria-describedby property not designed reference descriptions external resourceâ€”since IDREF, reference element same DOM document. different HTML longdesc attribute, URI. general, preferred pattern WAI-ARIA applications include relevant resources same DOM, wish reference external resource aria-describedby, reference link turn references external resource. user follow steps, first following aria-describedby arc, then following link, address use case. following example <p> <img src="images/histogram.png" alt="Histogram Blackberry tree heights" width="40%" aria-describedby="longdesc1" <a id="longdesc1" href="blackberry-description.html" target="_description">Data Blackberry Histogram</a></p> not good practice use pattern describing elementâ€”the <a> tag @id='longdesc1'â€”is hidden, there way user navigate activate link. Use technique only description not hidden. Owning Controlling relationships expand logical structure WAI-ARIA Web application. are aria-owns aria-controls Â TheÂ aria-owns relationship parent/child relationship be completely determined DOM created parsing markup. TheÂ aria-controls relationship cause-and-effect relationship so assistive technologies navigate content effected changes content user operating. Relationship addition WAI-ARIA role state information, document element,an assistive technology needs convey context. Inthe case treeitem, important know parent provide folder depth number siblings folder. containment hierarchy often be determined bythe DOM tree, parent, siblings, children givendocument element. said, DOM hierarchy rigid acyclical inthat node only have parent. situations, childis reused multiple parents child separated itssibilings parent DOM tree. example radio buttonappears table not DOM child radiogroup, due theauthors use table formatting placement radio buttonsplacing radiogroup container. solve problemWAI-ARIA aria-owns property. aria-owns property set document element, values are theunique IDs adopted children. elements appear anywherein DOM, yet are treated siblings owning parent. Thisexample radiogroup first uses DOM hierarchy toconvey context then aria-owns: First, consider preferred method using W3C DOM describe relationship radiogroup radio roles HTML: <div id="radio_label">My radio label</div><ul role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="radio_label"><li role="radio">Item role="radio">Item role="radio">Item example, elements role="radio" are child nodes parent role="radiogroup" element node. Now, consider alternative method using aria-owns property describe parent-childrole relationship radiogroup radio roles HTML: <table><tr><td role="radiogroup" aria-owns="myradio1 myradio2 myradio3" rowspan="3" >My Radio Label</td><td id="myradio1" role="radio">Item id="myradio2" role="radio">Item id="myradio3" role="radio">Item aria-owns property be used sparingly, itincreases computational load assistive technology providealternative renderings. Also, accessing DOM enumeratingchildren DOM node, then enumerate adopted childrenusing aria-owns property. instance walking DOM, theparent adopted children adopted parent not DOMparent. avoid recursion problems. child, adopted natural, have appropriate aria-posinset aria-setsize properties set consistent theirrendering, be determined DOM direct parsing ofthe host language. Places direct parsing not allow useragent determine aria-posinset aria-setsize are long lists onlythe currently visible items are loaded Ajax). children arere-sorted then aria-posinset aria-setsize values be updatedconsistent visual rendering. Rather setting size only container, content authors specify aria-setsize member set avoid performance issues. Â property not set, user agent compute set property supporting roles. Platform accessibility API mappings invert relationship assistive technologies, so determine owning parent child couple aria-posinset aria-setsize information provide context information user. Â Using Reusable Content are re-using content different, transient sections content restyling render association different object, need maintain aria-owns property well match current use apparent ancestry reused sub-section. good example context help menu end document. user wishes launch context help menu association different visual elements, styling used render menu context object. Prior rendering visual submenu ensure object have requested help aria-owns property value submenu ID. menu closes remove aria-owns property. Controls Relationship rich internet applications document elements control behavior part Web page TheÂ aria-controls attribute cause-and-effect relationships document elements. example be group radio buttons contents listbox part page. Here, want radio group assign aria-controls relationship listbox be updating page reload. user, assistive technology, then navigate listbox following aria-controls relationship different radio selected, see contents changed listbox. ability update parts page page reload common practice applications making use Ajax. aria-controls attribute, user be unable effectively use types Web pages assistive technologies often not make user aware happening context element user currently operating. aria-controls attribute user use assistive technology follow relationship object controlling. extremely important assistive technology present changes document response user input. Therefore, assistive technology immediately presents changes live region controlling widget user keyboard focus. example, tree view controls help document pane, time tree item changes new tree item then new help contents also be read. case screen reader, amount information read target live region dependent live region configured. aria-controls attribute more ids refer document element. relationship not implied host language semantics, then controlling element be given controls attribute IDs other elements changes show up listed attribute value. Changing Reading Flow number disadvantages keyboard navigation today. such example restriction navigation tabbing order. common problem presentations office suites logical, perceivable, navigation order slide not match tabbing order. Sighted users see logical navigation process visual steps process assembling lawn mower). not conveyed tab order. user tab step land step problem construction model-based authoring tools Web page. model-based authoring tool, visual object provide number paths user take, such multiplexor, have output logically flows number optional electronic components drawing. Web developers are actually creating drawings perform tasks such visually model work flow. scenario, user want decide object navigate screen reader alternate input device next. recommended Tab order follow reading flow, there be instances not possible. reasons, WAI-ARIA relationship property, called aria-flowto. author provide assistive technology alternative navigation flows document best author's intent more logical people disabilities. aria-flowto recommended reading order content, so assistive overriding default reading document order user. aria-flowto not change keyboard navigation order browser. Consider first case changing basic reading flow circumvent tabbing. good example logical reading flow portal landmarks. future, user wish change reading flow based order priority navigate personalized Web application. following example, navigation follow order News Stories", listings", quotes", friends" following document reading order. However, author end user determine main content most important, followed quotes", friends", then listings." end user change order web page assistive technology interface such personalization. <html> â€¦ <div role="main" title="Top News Stories" id="main" aria-flowto="stock"></div> <div role="complementary" title="television listings" id="tv"></div><div role="complementary" title="stock quotes" id="stock" aria-flowto="messages"></div><div role="complementary" title="messages friends" id="messages" aria-flowto="tv"></div> second use case such Web developer wish circumvent flow branching multiple paths Web page, requiring assistive technology present collection options user go next. important work flows business process management applications. More applications are becoming Web based, vehicle required tell user get work flow. flowto property multiple idrefs, allowing author define object user flow implement technique do following. Make object work flow accessible require assigning title WAI-ARIA label object unique HTML id. Also, html element repurposed assign WAI-ARIA role. <html>â€¦ <img src="foo.jpg" id="331" title="What Invoice Value?"> <img src="foo.jpg" id="333" title="Finance Manager Approval"> <img src="foo.jpg" id="334" title="Sales Manager Approval"> â€¦ Assign flowto properties visual object flow more other objects assign flowto property list IDs flows. <html> â€¦ <img src="foo.jpg" id="331" title="What Invoice Value?" aria-flowto="333 <img src="foo.jpg" id="333" title="Finance Manager Approval"> <img src="foo.jpg" id="334" title="Sales Manager Approval"> â€¦ element referenced flowto have have unique id. combination unique id name allow assistive technology adequately assist user retracing steps backward flow reference moving forward author sets only target user agent responsible mapping backward reference relationship. Therefore, user agent user get lost. host user agent not provide alternative navigation order; assistive technology function. Make sure visual objects are keyboard accessible Use tabindex enable objects receive focus. Actually setting focus be performed assistive technology, such alternative input device. example places drawing object document order respect tab sequence. <img src="foo.jpg" id="331" title="What Invoice Value?" aria-flowto="333 tabindex="0"><img src="foo.jpg" id="333" title="Finance Manager Approval" tabindex="0"><img src="foo.jpg" id="334" title="Sales Manager Approval" tabindex="0">â€¦ assistive technology encounters Invoice Value?," know tell user choose navigate Manager Approval" Manager Approval" object. options be provided menu Invoice Value object assistive technology. choice made, then move focus target object; case screen reader, just move user location screen reader's virtual buffer. Note: WAI-ARIA not specify backward flowto properties same reason do not have reverse relationships labelledby. author incorrectly do reversal, creating whole set new problems.

Implementing Live Regions Live regions are parts Web page author change. Examples live regions include tables dynamically updated content stats, stock information), logs new information being added transcript logs), notification areas etc. Live regions enable assistive technologies, such screen readers, be informed updates losing users' place content. Live region settings provide hints assistive technologies process updates. Note assistive technology responsible handling updates enabling users override hints. section Live Region Properties use details apply live region properties. process help rich internet application developers set live region settings provide good user experience most assistive technology users little configuration part. applying live region properties, recommended conduct user testing. supports scripting response live regions wish customize response, such screen reader script Web page. Identify live regions Live regions are region page dynamic updates client-side scripting. Note regions page be live. See special case live regions meet needs WAI-ARIA number special case live region roles live region properties are pre-defined use. live region roles meet needs just apply specific role region Web page. Decide priority live region live region changes, user be notified change? Notifications include sound screen reader user. simplicity, use case audio notification discussion.) shorter interval changes less important information, less likely user needs hear change. simple example changes not be heard are changes time; sound second be very annoying. user hear change, change be announced immediately, soon possible, only user idle? Announcing change immediately be disorienting users, so be done sparingly. Most updates probably only be announced user idle. have decided priority live region, then decide live property value: Never spoken, then aria-live="off" Spoken user idle, then aria-live="polite" Spoken soon possible, then aria-live="assertive" more specifics, see Live Region Properties. Decide much context needed update part live region changes, much context needed understand change. Does user need hear entire live region just change user needs hear entire live region, then mark entire live region aria-atomic="true". Decide types changes are relevant live region possible types changes are: additions, removals, text. Additions means new nodes are added DOM; removals means nodes are removed DOM; text means changes are solely textual content. user hear types changes only certain types? default, user hear additions text type changes. wish explicitly define types changes, need set relevant="THE_TYPES_OF_CHANGES". more type change relevant, types are separated space. example, define additions removals relevant not text, set relevant="additions removals". 5.2.1. Live Region Properties Use Them most important concepts live regions politeness. Politeness much priority live region following politeness values are available aria-live: off, polite, assertive. aria-live="off" default. updates made region not be announced user. live="off" be sensible setting things update very frequently such GPS moving vehicle. aria-live="polite" updates made region only be announced user not currently doing anything. live="polite" be used most situations involving live regions present new information users, such updating news headlines. aria-live="assertive" updates made region are important enough be announced user soon possible, not necessary immediately interrupt user. live="assertive" be used there information user know right away, example, warning messages form validation fly. are times suppress presentation changes region updating. use aria-busy property. aria-busy suppress presentation changes region finished updating number rapid-fire changes are finished, set aria-busy then clear attribute region finished. busy, track collate changes. finally speak changes once region longer busy. live region updated, update often be announced own still make sense. example, news headline added, make sense simply announce headline. However, sometimes entire live region be read order give user enough context make sense update. example, not make sense only give current value stock saying name stock. atomic setting assistive technologies hint cases update aria-atomic="false" default. means there change region, change be presented own; not present entire region. atomic="false" generally good idea presents users only changes not cause hear repetitive information not changed. However, Web developers take care changed information, presented still be understood contextualized user. aria-atomic="true" atomic set means region be presented whole; there change, present entire region, not just change. atomic="true" make harder users understand changes changed areas are not presented independently. atomic="true" also be annoying force users listen repetitive information not changed. However, atomic="true" necessary cases change, presented be understood contextualized user. Note aria-atomic="true", attempt speak atomic region only once multiple changes occur same region been spoken yet. Not updates live region are relevant. example, oldest headline list headlines removed new headline added, removal oldest headline probably not important enough announce user. However, chat application, user leaves chat username removed list users, removal be important enough announce. relevant setting hint types changes are relevant be announced. change not relevant be treated region had live="off" not be announced. Multiple types changes be listed relevant; types are separated space. default relevant="additions text" most common use case. default applicable application, do not need provide relevant property explicitly. aria-relevant="additions" Insertion nodes live region be considered relevant. aria-relevant="removals" Removal nodes live region be considered relevant. Often, removals are not relevant nodes are removed make space new information e.g. log implemented table items are taken top. However, case something buddy list, relevant buddy removed. require screen reader speak removal, screen reader be useful do so. Use aria-relevant="removals" aria-relevant="all" be used sparingly. Notification assistive technology content removed cause unwarranted number changes be notified user. aria-relevant="text" Changes textual content nodes already exist live region be considered relevant. Textual content text equivalents, such alt attribute images. example shows live regions. regions update simultaneously, liveRegionA be spoken first message higher priority liveRegionB. <div id="liveRegionA" aria-live="assertive"> </div> <div id="liveRegionB" aria-live="polite> </div> Choosing Special Case Live Regions wish use special live region role instead applying live region properties. WAI-ARIA number standard roles are default considered sections Web page. important know use create custom live region known. Here are rules thumb: alert use alert role one-time notification shows period time away intended alert user something happened. assistive technology be notified user agent alert occurred, operating system supports type event notification. choosing use alert use alertdialog role instead something alert receive focus. alert alertdialog appear pop-up user get attention. status use status role want mark area updated periodically general status Web application. Changes status are not typically announced automatically assistive technology. However, possible configure assistive technologies, such scriptable screen reader, watch changes status bar announce Using status role also important user always check status section changes status different Web pages. Many applications provide status widgets are often found, visibly, bottom application contain variety widgets convey status. use status not guarantee respond changes status. author still put live="off" live="assertive" influence ATs treatment status. timer use timer role want mark area amount elapsed time start point, time remaining end point. text encapsulated timer current time measurement, are updated amount changes. However, timer value not necessarily machine parsable. text contents MUST be updated fixed intervals, timer paused reaches end-point. marquee- use marquee role need mark area scrolling text such stock ticker. latest text scrolled area be available DOM. marquee live region, assumed default aria-live property value log use log have live area new information added, scrolling chat log text. other regions, implied semantics indicate arrival new items reading order. log meaningful sequence new information added only end log, not arbitrary points. have chat text entry area indicate also controls aria log aria so: <div contenteditable="true" role="log" id="chatlog"></div><label id="gettext">Send Text</label><div aria-controls="chatlog" role="textbox" contenteditable="true" aria-labelledby="gettext"></div live region have other live area use case, WAI-ARIA mark area using aria-live attribute. accompanied collection attributes support live property allow create own custom live area Web page. more details regarding live regions refer live region section guide. Live region roles are applied elements having strong native semantics are not mapped consistently platform accessibility API. example TABLE element. recommended authors apply live regions DIV SPAN containers. example: <!-- Live region role used TABLE element: role not consistently mapped platform AAPI. Do not use. role="log" â€¦ > â€¦</table><!-- Wrap TABLE element DIV role instead: role="log" â€¦ > <table â€¦ > â€¦ </table></div> Presentation Role section presentation role, including conditions inherited element's children. Rationale Authors devote good deal effort appearance web pages, especially true case scripted web applications. end authors employ various elements purely visual presentation. example, <img> elements are used spacing decoration; <table>s are used create column based layout. Elements used strictly presentation are semantically neutral irrelevant terms accessibility. necessary mark such elements presentational so do not appear accessible tree created user agent. example, current technique used spacer images provide blank alt text indicate image not meaningful. User agents not publish information images blank alt text platform accessibility API. are elements other <img> <table> are used solely visual presentation. element potential candidate presentation, so used, elements also need be marked semantically neutral. Note: important separate content presentation. CSS introduced new table layout functionality allow user agent layout content using CSS. are many advantages using feature CSS such browser style sheet caching improved adaptability mobile devices limited screen real estate. are, however, cases presentational markup be avoided. such instances, authors are counseled consult WCAG more detailed guidance. WAI-ARIA presentation role general device marking elements presentational. presentation role overrides element's native implicit role, informs user agent not publish element accessiblity API. fact, preferred way mark <img> elements decorative use role="presentation" attribute instead addition empty alt attribute. Here code fragment sample: <!-- informs user agent spacer images are layout only. Histories Architecture</h1><p> <a href="www.somewhere.com">Ancient Roman Architecture</a> <img src="spacer.png" role="presentation"> <a href="somewhere.else.com">19th Century Italian Architecture</a> <img src="spacer.png" role="presentation"> <a href="www.elsewhere.com">Modern Buildings more Years Old</a></p><h2>Modern Building Design</h1>â€¦ resulting accessible tree shown Note none spacer <img> elements are present: root â€¦ h2 Other Histories Architecture p Ancient Roman Architecture 19th Century Italian Architecture Modern Buildings more Years Old h2 Modern Building Design â€¦ Inheritance Presentation Parent Element's Children general, presentation role not inherited element's children. exceptions are elements role element required owned children. Examples include <table> element list role, exceptions are discussed further other elements, only element marked presentational eliminated accessible tree. Note, however, contents are published; particular, element's textual content published, attributes element form text-equivalent are not. example, header element presentation role not appear accessible tree, text image role presentation not exposed accessible tree, contents alt attribute. shown following code fragment: <!-- implicit role semantics not affect contents. <h1 role="presentation">Presentation role overrides Header role</h1><h1>Another header</h1> <!-- hides image accessibility API not publish alt attribute contents. <img role="presentation" alt="This text not appear Accessibility API" src="â€¦"> first header element absent accessible tree example, text second header element present heading. img element not exposed root â€¦ Presentation role overrides Header role h1 header â€¦ Be aware markup <img role="presentation" alt="non-empty alt text"â€¦> fact contradictory: Declaring role presentation image layout, decorative meaningless, non-empty alt text image meaningful. recommended authors instead use empty alt text use role="presentation". Earlier was noted presentation role not generally inherited element's children. exception are roles have required owned elements. Examples include <table> element, list tree roles. list required have listitem children; tree, treeitem children. <table> element's child components are <tbody>, <thead>, <tfoot>, <th>, <tr>, <td>, <caption>. component elements not appear markup enclosing <table> root element. Thus, table used layout, component elements are present markup layout well. annotating required child elements role="presentation" error prone difficult maintain, sufficient mark table root element presentational. presentation role table component elements. However, before, contents table elements do appear accessible tree. Here example: <!-- Layout table marked role="presentation"> <tbody> <tr> <td>Some text</td> <td><p>Paragraph</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="www.somewhere.com">Link text</a></td> <td><img src="meaningful.jpg" alt="meaningful image"></td> </tr> </tbody></table> table specific elements tr, td, etc.) are eliminated tree inheriting presentation role, other elements textual content table cells are exposed: root â€¦ text p Paragraph Link text img meaningful image â€¦ same logic other roles have required owned children, such list. list's root element declared presentational using role="presentation", listitem elements inherit presentation role, none list item elements appear accessible tree. However, contents list item, other elements textual content, are included tree. Overriding Presentation presentation role overridden circumstances. Recall presentation role informs user agents certain elements are semantically neutral, are irrelevant accessibility. however, there aspect element makes meaningful, longer neutral, simultaneously be presentational. User Agent Implementation Guide cases element focusable. element global WAI-ARIA attribute, other aria-hidden. element referenced element's aria-controls, aria-describedby, aria-flowto, aria-labelledby, aria-owns property. element normally inherits presentation parent, element explicitly role other presentation. E.g., table cell, <td>, <table role="presentation">, cell marked button role: <td role="button" â€¦> cell role button, not presentation. situations entail given element semantically relevant appear accessible tree. Marking element role="presentation" error, user agents ignore presentation role cases. Authors are advised not mark element role presentation properties; rather, use role element's purpose. Form Properties section authoring practices elements used form elements. Use aria-invalid aria-required Improve Access Forms introduction WAI-ARIA's aria-invalid state aria-required property, only presentational strategies have been available Web content authors indicate certain form fields controls are required invalid. applications, states are only available styling varying markup, inconsistent, therefore inconclusive. Web-based forms, fields required be marked asterisk. Forms submitted required data missing improperly specified be redisplayed unacceptable elements highlighted red. assistive technology user poorly served such imprecise methods, users confront inconsistent indicators consistent situations. WAI-ARIA invalid state required property provide: programmatic aria-required property be applied form element indicate required complete form. programmatic aria-invalid state be used indicate data fields have incorrect data so user have entered invalid data.

Screen readers alternate input systems assist user degree allowing user simulate click, drag, release operation. then up user find target hopefully, receive object(s) being dragged. Additionally, user not be aware desired drop operation supported source objects be selected dragging. end result be very unproductive frustrating experience. WAI-ARIA new Drag Drop properties aide Web application authors drag drop process, called aria-grabbed aria-dropeffect. property aria-grabbed applied source(s) being dragged, aria-dropeffect applied target(s). Use properties--combined best practices enabling user select appropriate drag operations assigning appropriate keyboard operations dragging dropping--will vastly improve accessibility drag drop functionality. following steps guide process. Identify draggable objects Set initial aria-grabbed state draggable interface objects. Roles typically support drag drop operations are listitem treeitem. default state objects assumed be undefined, meaning are not draggable. objects be dragged, set aria-grabbed state allow assistive technologies indicate objects are draggable potentially facilitate choosing objects grab. Objects be dragged need have determinable role. HTML tags such <div> <span> provide semantics, <select>, require set WAI-ARIA role attribute. step clearly marks elements be drag-and-drop operation. Assistive technologies, such screen readers alternate input devices, help user move focus directly grab-supporting objects having navigate elements guess be ready initiate drag operation. not necessary, authors intermediaries use CSS highlight elements be grabbed. point, qualified drop targets be determined are determined based objects being dragged--which have not yet been selected. grabbable objects be navigable using keyboard. Allow user initiate appropriate drag operation using keyboard author provide keyboard accessible way selecting more elements drag. recommended space bar be used selection. further recommended Shift+Space be used select multiple objects define contiguous set; control+space be used define noncontiguous set. object selected, aria-grabbed property be set giving ATs references been grabbed. recommended Control+M be supported indicate objects have been selected drag. Note: Selection objects be dragged differ depending type. example, list emails be selected time many time contiguous non-contiguous manner using Space key indicated However, text document better be selected positioning cursor beginning word holding down Control key using right left arrow keys mark letters wish move. Mark drop targets user completed selecting source objects drag, indicate targets receive setting aria-dropeffect properties targets. indicate assistive technology objects have been grabbed well targets are capable receiving drop. using mouse, users click, hold mouse button, drag mouse moving selected objects, implication, are longer selecting respect keyboard users, previous section, Item user initiate appropriate drag operation using keyboard", using Control+M indicate end selection phase. copy: duplicate source object be dropped target. move: source object be removed original location dropped target. link: reference short cut dragged object be created target object. execute: function supported drop target executed, using drag source input. popup: author provide popup menu dialog allow user choose drag operations move, reference) other drag functionality, such drag cancel. none: drop operation supported. default objects. Example: <div role="treeitem" aria-dropeffect="copy move popup"> CSS also be used highlight targets show sighted users objects receive drop grabbed source(s). object aria-dropeffect property set have assumed aria-dropeffect value object aria-dropeffect value ignored ATs drop operation. Implement keyboard functionality assist user executing drop. objects have been grabbed, author provide standard keyboard accessible navigation tabbing) enable user navigate desired drop target. achieve optionally support Shift+F10 invoke single select list possible drop targets user choose single drop target selected, move focus drop target.Otherwise, provide keyboard accessible way tabbing arrowing) allow user navigate drop target. user's point regard be clearly visible navigation. user drop target author provide keyboard accessible way drop selected object(s) target. Control+M be used provide most intuitive type drop, copy, move, shortcut. case only drop operation available, Control+M be used drop selected object(s) target. drop target supports additional drop operations, then author provide WAI-ARIA-enabled pop-up menu user choose supported operations list. recommended way invoke menu use Shift+Control+M key sequence focus drop target. Furthermore, aria-dropeffect property include list values indicate keyboard accessible menu provided. user selected action pop-up menu, menu close, focus returning drop target. user not choose action instead presses Escape key, application dismiss menu, returning focus drop target. Cancelling drag operation Users cancel entire drag operation time, exception, pressing Escape key. exception drop operations pop-up menu displayed previous step case, Escape simply pop-up, second Escape keystroke needed cancel drag operation. drag operation so cancelled, aria-dropeffect properties are set grabbable objects' aria-grabbed properties are set keyboard focus returns last grabbed source object. Clean-up drag/drop Once drop occurred, clean up DOM do drag-and-drop operation. include setting: aria-dropeffect properties remove altogether. aria-grabbed draggable objects objects are not grabbable omit aria-grabbed property have aria-grabbed property set Focus appropriate DOM element, role also be determinable. Other methods performing same operation drag-and-drop be best way meet accessibility requirements. example, moving mail message inbox folder, list folders be presented select list alternative drag-and-drop.

Examples include action confirmation warning messages, help invalid form entry. dialog be modal. Keyboard focus set element dialog. element initial focus depend nature information conveyed dialog. Simple message dialogs, described have initial focus set confirmation button button). Detail message dialogs have initial focus set element containing message. detail message dialog message following attributes: more sentence length; information punctuation essential part message, such syntax required date format; detail information user need re-use, e.g., phone number, e-mail address, error number, etc.; interactive element, such link help resource. dialog not detail message dialog, consider simple message dialog. Keyboard Interaction: See Dialog Content authors make alert dialogs modal ensuring alertdialog shown, keyboard mouse interactions only operate dialog. message area detail message dialog focusable document role so screen reader users have complete access message content, e.g., screen reader read character, word, line. message area dialog focusable focus, visual focus indicator message recommended. WAI-ARIA Roles, States, Properties: node containing elements dialog, including alert message dialog buttons, alertdialog role. Message areas have role document tabindex="0". Alert dialog aria-labelledby references title dialog. there not visible title, use appropriate aria-label instead. element role alertdialog aria-describedby referring message element role document. Example: Open Ajax Alliance Auto Complete Characteristics: Description: textbox associated drop-down list choices choices offered are filtered based information typed box. Typically, icon associated textbox triggers display drop-down list choices. editable auto-complete text entry choices are not list. example editable auto-complete URL field browsers. Keyboard Interaction: focus empty textbox, press Down Arrow, Arrow, Alt+Down Arrow, Alt+Up Arrow display entire list choices. Focus remains textbox choice highlighted. Press Down Arrow highlight first choice list. Press Down Arrow Arrow keys highlight desired choice list. Note arrows wrap textbox top bottom list reached. example, pressing down arrow last choice highlighted move focus back textbox, pressing down again move focus first item list.
