Table Contents Not included version. Introduction CC/PP data not personal, i.e. tied named user, there are number ways user be identified holder profile, e.g. identity transmision HTTP parameters, recognition IP-number such, there need suggested privacy method implementors. Descriptions single features description terminal users preferences terminal be used be used infringe users privacy. However, profile collection such properties, be used personalize information; closer personalization, bigger risk user be identified specific use terminal; bigger risk misuse privacy standpoint. also possible risk user be identified having certain abilities constantly requests text double-sized fonts, likely hard seeing), be possible misuse. Generally speaking, user not want share data CC/PP profile, wish have control information Origin servers customizing content therefore express user user agent regarding privacy practices regard use CC/PP data, so user make decision not share data server. P3P way origin server express privacy policy user terminal. match P3P CC/PP not perfect, intent implementation are different, be used together enhance privacy protection user. CC/PP abbreviation Capability/Preference Profiles", extensible format based RDF describing device capabilities user preferences. general, user preferences device capabilities need be protected malicious use there trust management framework CC/PP so far. trust management, sensitive information attacks malicious servers content providers. do not aim create new technologies terms network security, authentication, message validation, personal privacy protection, cryptography. intend employ existing technologies terms trust management considering apply such technologies well fit use cases CC/PP. Scope document document discussion document, containing implementation advice developers services based CC/PP. interactions CC/PP P3P given current state implementations. However, CC/PP only data structure not protocol, work be taken future input formal specification, currently be seen advice implementors only. Protocol transport issues. currently, CC/PP protocol. are number proposals, various reasons, group not chartered develop protocol. do so soon possible, require rechartering. Meanwhile, there are proposals: CC/PP Exchange Protocol, W-HTTP protocol. Note be possible use header Mark Baker draft-baker-xhtml-media-reg-01.txt draft-baker-xhtml-media-reg-02.txt reference CC/PP profile mechanism been demonstrated Kiniko Yasuda Keio University). are main ways transporting CC/PP HTTP: Using CC/PP Exchange Protocol, using UAProf W-HTTP Protocol. CC/PP Exchange Protocol CC/PP Exchange Protocol was presented W3C Note June uses HTTP Extension Framework intent was provide framework was possible map HTTP headers, handle defaults URIs. idea was minimize data transfer air, goal was accomplished, been demonstrated Kiniko Yasuda Keio University. CCPP-ex uses headers, defaults updates are separated using MD5 hashes. third header warning information. protocol documented W3C Note exchange protocol based HTTP Extension Framework". CC/PP framework mechanism describing capabilities preferences associated users user agents accessing World Wide Web. Information user agents hardware platform, system software, applications user preferences. user agent capabilities preferences be thought metadata, properties descriptions user agent's hardware software. CC/PP descriptions are intended provide information necessary adapt content content delivery mechanisms best fit capabilities preferences user agents. major disadvantage format verbose. networks are very slow be moderately expensive way handle metadata. are several optimizations possible help deal network performance issues. strategy use compressed form XML, complementary strategy use references Instead enumerating set attributes, reference be used name collection attributes such hardware platform defaults. advantage enabling separate fetching caching functional subsets. problem propagate changes current CC/PP descriptions origin server, gateway proxy. solution transmit entire CC/PP descriptions change. not ideal slow networks. alternative send only changes. CC/PP exchange protocol not depend profile format Therefore profile format CC/PP description format be applied CC/PP exchange protocol. example, user agent issues request URIs address profile information, user agent changes value attribute, such turning sound off, only change sent together URIs. origin server request, origin server inquires CC/PP repositories CC/PP descriptions using list URIs. Then origin server tailored content using fully enumerated CC/PP descriptions. origin server not obtain fully enumerated CC/PP descriptions CC/PP repositories not available. case, implementation origin server respond request tailored content, non-tailored content error. case, origin server inform user agent fact. warning mechanism been introduced purpose. likely origin server, gateway proxy be concerned different device capabilities user preferences. example, origin server have responsibility select content according users preferred language, proxy have responsibility transform encoding format content. Therefore gateways proxies not forward profile information origin server. CC/PP exchange protocol convey natural language codes header field-values. Therefore internationalization issues be considered. internationalization policy CC/PP exchange protocol based RFC2277. Considering maintain session RTSP worthwhile point view minimizing transactions session mechanism permit client avoid resending elements CC/PP descriptions have not changed last time information was transmitted). However session mechanism reduce cache efficiency, maintaining states user agent origin server. extension declaration used indicate extension been applied message possibly reserve part header namespace identified header field prefix. HTTP Extension Framework types extension declaration strength: mandatory optional, types extension declaration scope: hop-by-hop end-to-end. type extension declaration strengths type extension declaration scopes be used user agent needs do. strength extension declaration be mandatory user agent needs obtain error response server(an origin server, gateway proxy) not comply CC/PP exchange protocol. strength extension declaration be optional user agent needs obtain non-tailored content server not comply CC/PP exchange protocol. scope extension declaration be hop-by-hop user agent priori knowledge first hop proxy complies CC/PP exchange protocol. scope extension declaration be end-to-end user agent priori knowledge first hop proxy not comply CC/PP exchange protocol, user agent not use proxy. Profile header field request-header field, list references address CC/PP descriptions. grammar Profile header field Header field Grammar Profile = profile-field-name profile-field-name = reference = <"> absoluteURI profile-diff-name <"> profile-diff-name = profile-diff-number profile-diff-digest profile-diff-number = profile-diff-digest = sp; < MD5 message digest encoded base64 > DIGIT = <any digit Profile header field-value list references. reference Profile header field corresponding entity CC/PP description. reference absolute URI profile-diff-name. entity CC/PP description represented absoluteURI request, entity CC/PP description represented profile-diff-name exisits request Profile-Diff header field. profile-diff-name Profile header field addresses CC/PP description corresponding Profile-Diff header same request. Profile header field profile-diff-name, corresponding Profile-Diff header MUST be included same request. main reason profile-diff-name introduced specify priority CC/PP description Profile header field-value. priority indicated order references absoluteURI profile-diff-name) Profile header field-value. latest reference Profile header field-value highest priority. Therefore CC/PP description represented latest reference override CC/PP descriptions are represented precedent references. default behavior absence schema rules. profile information be represented absoluteURIs Profile header. case, Profile-Diff header field not have be added request. other hand, only Profile-Diff header contain profile information. case, Profile header only profile-diff-name Profile-Diff header. W-HTTP WAP Forum UAProf group defined transport CC/PP W-HTTP Profiled HTTP). be found section UAProf specification. case mobile terminal supports wireless profiled HTTP profile transported using meta data defined bythis specification. CC/PP Framework remains unaltered. defined mechanism functional equivalent CC/PP exchange protocol definition syntax semantics transport remains specification. Using W-HTTP transport CC/PP following extension headers are defined transport CC/PP W-HTTP. defined extension headers are considered be end end headers.. X-WAP-PROFILE x-wap-profile header general header field MUST contain following URI referencing CC/PP profile, reference profile difference, transported using x-wap-profile-diff combination multiple instances types data. data MAY be generated mobile terminal attached intermediary point request origin server. case Push header MAY be generated response request. case Push data be cached. However header MUST be present request response UAProf used. x-wap-profile header MAY contain references instances x-wap-profile-diff header following section reference parts, sequence number profile-digest. sequence number used determine order x-wap-profile-diff headers be applied digest used validate profile-desc x-wap-profile-diff header value correct. X-WAP-PROFILE-DIFF x-wap-profile-diff header general header MAY be generated mobile terminal intermediate proxy enhance alter CPI. be multiple profile differences, profile difference also have reference x-wap-profile header order differences be applied. header parts, sequence identifier entity part CC/PP description being enhanced. header MAY be present request response. case Push data be cached. X-WAP-PROFILE-WARNING x-wap-profile-warning header general header. Essentially, same X-WAP-PROFILE-WARNING header CC/PP Exchange Protocol. presence level response been tailored relation profile data been supplied request. header MAY be present request response. warning codes are defined fall following categories reserved ·100 reserved content been adapted depending profile server incapable processing CPI. x-wap-profile-warning have following values. 200Not applied value MUST be included content not been tailored, sent representation, only representation available server. 201Content selection applied MUST be included included content been selected representations available. Content generation applied MUST be included content been tailored generated result applying included profile. Transformation applied MUST be added intermediate proxy transformation changing content-coding based CPI data. 500Not Supported Indicates entity sending warning code not support UAProf. Protocol Procedures Air transport variant headers values are not compressed air transmission. recommended hardware software manufacturer only use x-wap-profile header indicate absoluteURI reference CPI mobile terminal transmitted air. However specification not preclude use x-wap-profile-diff case. Combining X-WAP-Profile X-WAP-Profile-Diff x-wap-profile-diff header included profile-diff-seq MUST match sequence number x-wap-profile header otherwise associated profile-diff-desc MUST NOT be processed. reference x-wap-profile-diff header parts, sequence number governs order x-wap-profile-diff headers are processed MD5 message digest used validate profile-desc contained x-wap-profile-diff. sequence MD5 validation do not match, particular profile-diff MUST be ignored. x-wap-profile-diff header added intermediate proxy, MUST NOT alter existing sequence x-wap-profile-diff headers, proxy MUST using available sequence number numeric order. digest associated x-wap-profile-diff MUST be generated applying MD5 message digest algorithm base64 algorithm, section MIME specification corresponding profile-desc part header field-value. MD5 algorithm input message arbitrary length output 128-bit digest" input. base64 algorithm input arbitrary binary data output printable encoding data input. Relationship HTTP Headers profile information referred x-wap-profile x-wap-profile-diff header not supersede HTTP request response header information. Caching x-wap-profile-warning header MUST NOT be used cache control purposes. server wishes indicate caching dependency based theseheaders then hit use Vary header defined section14.44 HTTP specification XML Protocol/SOAP CC/PP be transported handled XML Protocol/SOAP not clear. something working group wishes investigate further. Other protocols WAP Forum provided mapping headers WSP, Wireless Session Protocol WAP UAPROF specification). Work also ongoing 3GPP transport CC/PP RSVP. Cases HTTP use case CC/PP intended be protocol neutral, work protocol transport Mappings have been produced other protocols, most notably WSP. However, be expected be implemented HTTP, using HTTP headers transport. working group also look transport CC/PP SOAP/XML Protocol future work item. Trust mechanisms Policy publishing not bring trust Trust be obtained other ways, even worth trouble publish policy. context, P3P rather be seen means retrieve user's consent data storage processing. client retrieve policy declaration server, match preferences client. However, P3P not defined other protocols HTTP. other mechanisms exist, knowledge, communicate policies client server. Note, however, known problem P3P nothing enforce policy assumed take place band. Using P3P HTTP document CC/PP exchange protocol based HTTP Extension Framework mechanism transport CC/PP HTTP described. document interaction take place, given P3P interaction well. policy be exchanged, client request server. not proxy trusted domain, client expose profile possibly malicious party CC/PP Exchange Protocol used, profile sent entirety first GET request. Thus, malicious server take profile do anything wanted relationship been established. solution transmit minimal profile part first request, described policy been received approved, full profile sent profile-diff). Note policy rejected, there currently way server maintain state users requests, there way server recognize client not approve policy, there fallback method P3P. Note possible profile declared be null profile content), correct profile be transferred diff approval servers policy. Note also state management mechanism server currently not specified. be possible use cookies ramifications discussion lead too far. interaction P3P have levels granularity: privacy policy CC/PP vocabulary statement stating data profile profile diff headers not be retained misused, be used only purposes content customization] b) policy specifically states attributes elements) CC/PP vocabulary collected state purpose. be extended later date include negotiation capabilities currently scope P3P1.0) alternately, user agent be smart enough parse elements send only attributes indicated policy) profile profile diff headers following acceptable site's policy. P3P CC/PPvocabularies P3P vocabulary defined XML. CC/PP vocabularies are defined RDF XML encoding RDF). P3P specification RDF encoding be made available; P3P elements be used CC/PP profiles vice versa). further information mixing namespaces profiles, see effort been advertised, CC/PP working group decided not create mapping own, await P3P working group efforts. alternative solution create CC/PP data schema P3P syntax, seem redundant RDF version P3P forthcoming. working groups continue investigate Safe Zone P3P specification concept zone". concept not exist priori CC/PP, protocol been defined. However, PIMI method described section be used provide safe zone way indicated P3P specification, section noted above, empty profile be used negotiating safe zone, instead minimal APPEL rules language defined CC/PP. Existing implementations make use XSLT predicate transformations Xpath, profile documents be addressed style sheet). future, foreseen there be need more extensive rule system, such decisions concern not just formatting, content well. regard, synergies APPEL rules language P3P be investigated. Use trusted intermediaries CC/PP Exchange protocol, profiles be referenced retrieved intermediary gateway other proxy). also possible entity handle P3P negotiations, mechanism delegate authority existed, end-to-end security was not required. occur situations user trusted domain, interfaced Internet proxy gateway. case, P3P negotiation be terminated proxy. also be necessary proxy not just keep cache documents, maintain database user state. even be necessary proxy become entity not just transcoding, also personalization behalf origin server. advantage user be personal information including CC/PP profile stays trusted proxy. advantage origin server owner harder identify, version document be delivered have be there not be record number retrievals, retrieved etc conversely, be seen privacy enhancement user). type system emerge, e.g. scope IETF WEBI APEX working groups, foresee issue become more important. However, mechanism transparent HTTP, be CC/PP, not discuss further extent here. Examples Using P3P CC/PP Exchange Protocol using method idea PIMI method client defined minimal profile non-contentious information be used infringe privacy client). minimal profile used initial request get privacy policy server. demonstrated using profile-diff headers CC/PP Exchange protocol, possible client signal satisfaction dissatisfaction policy returning profile difference not. response empty diff, server provide document not contain adaption have been done using information client not reveal. profile" most likely subjective. Ultimately, user have determine information give out. However, purposes discussion, assume properties enable generic display data input device, expressing preferences modifications, constitute minimum. imply following, using properties defined WAP UAProf drafting committee: Screen size Color capable document, propose empty diff be sent response second GET), imply profile not changed.
