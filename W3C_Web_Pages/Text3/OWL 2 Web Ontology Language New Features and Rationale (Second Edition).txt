Use Case Use Case Use Case Extended datatype capabilities F10: Extra Datatypes Datatype Restrictions OWL support only integers strings datatypesand not support subsets datatypes. example, state person age, integer, not restrict range datatype say adults have age greater OWL new capabilities datatypes, supporting richer set datatypes restrictions datatypes facets, XML Schema. OWL datatypes include various kinds numbers, adding support wider range XML Schema Datatypes float, decimal, positiveInteger, etc.) providing own datatypes, e.g., owl:real; b) strings Language Tag rdf:PlainLiteral datatype); c) boolean values, binary data, IRIs, time instants, etc. DatatypeRestriction also makes possible specify restrictions datatypes means constraining facets constrain range values allowed given datataype,by length strings) e.g., minLength, maxLength, minimum/maximum value, e.g., minInclusive, maxInclusive.Extended datatypes are allowed many description logics are supported several reasoners.Normative Syntax Direct SemanticsRDF-Based Semantics DatatypeRestriction( DT F1 lt1 Fn ltn DT unary datatype â¨ Fi lti â©, n are pairs constraining facet literal.

OWL DL separation somewhat allow different uses same term, e.g., Eagle, be used class, class Eagles, individual, individual representing species Eagle belonging plant animal species. However, OWL DL still certain restrictions: name be used class datatype name only be used kind property. OWL Direct Semantics different uses same name completely separate, required DL reasoners.

IRIs Uniform Resource Locators were used OWL identifyclasses, ontologies, other ontology elements. URIs are stringsformed using subset ASCII. was quite limiting, particularlywith respect non-English language names ASCII only includesletters English alphabet. support broad international needs, OWL uses Internationalized Resource Identifiers identifyingontologies elements. Imports Versioning OWL ontologies be stored Semantic Web documents, ontologies import other ontologies. OWL makes clear importing location ontology document. OWL also up relationship ontology name andits location response several requests, simpleversioning mechanism means version names OWL 2ontology have ontology IRI, used identify theontology. OWL ontology also have version IRI, used toidentify particular version ontology.

Minor features other changes have been introduced OWL syntax, are not changes expressive power respect OWL Anonymous Individuals OWL anonymous individuals were introduced individuals identifiers.

Nothing changed RDF side, treatment anonymous individuals OWL fully backwards compatible OWL example above, simply blank node RDF graph. Use Case Inverse Properties OWL properties are atomic, possible assert object property inverse property.

Profiles F15: OWL EL, OWL QL, OWL RL OWL defined major dialects, OWL DL OWL Full, syntactic subset Lite). However, turned was not sufficient address requirements later identified deployments OWL ontologies. Many applications, particularly life sciences, use very large ontologies, e.g.; FMA, NCI Thesaurus, SNOMED CT, Gene Ontology OBO ontologies. Such ontologies often need represent complex entities anatomical entities composed parts connected complex ways) allow propagation properties location diseases parts whole); also have huge number classes, heavy use made classification order facilitate development maintenance. Applications are, therefore, mainly concerned language scalability reasoning performance problems e.g., issues surrounding FMA are willing trade expressiveness return computational guarantees, particularly w.r.t. classification. Many applications involving classical databases are concerned interoperability OWL database technologies tools. ontologies used such applications are typically relatively lightweight, are often used query very large sets individuals stored standard relational databases. therefore, requirement access such data directly relational queries SQL). Other applications are concerned interoperability ontology language rules existing rule engines. ontologies used such applications are again typically relatively lightweight, be used query large datasets, be useful necessary operate directly data form RDF triples.

Other Design Choices Rationale OWL fully backwards compatible OWL conceptual design slightly different, particular regarding OWL syntax.

OWL frame-like syntax several features class, property individual be defined single axiom once. cause problems practice.

OWL however, entities be used being subject such axiom, there be many such axioms relating same entity. OWL addressed problems several ways. First, frame-like notation been dropped favor more fine-grained structure axioms: axiom just feature given entity. Second, OWL explicit declarations, explicit definition notion structural consistency. OWL more verbose, not expected lead problems given most OWL ontologies are created using ontology engineering tools. following example OWL frame-like axiom.

OWL/XML Syntax OWL Working Group defined XML syntax OWL based XML Schema Schema], called XML_Serialization, OWL/XML XML]. syntax structural specification OWL Specification].
