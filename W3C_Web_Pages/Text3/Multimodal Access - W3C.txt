Multimodal technology promising candidate future human machine interfaces improve Web accessibility various conditions environments users. example, days access Web using various devices including mobile phones, PDA, car navigation system home appliances. However, concrete access methods strongly depend type devices services, are quite different other. applications are based W3C standards. However, many are based proprietary platforms technologies. So global universal standardized mechanism various kinds devices services required materialize Web" person access specific information using modalities devices anywhere time. Capabilities Multimodal Access capabilities multimodal applications include voice GUI interaction. Standards multimodal interfaces be scalable enable richer capabilities subsequent generations multimodal devices. encourage rapid adoption, same content be designed use old/simple new/multimodal devices. example, people new multimodal devices get experience multimodal capabilities, users old simple devices get use keypad stylus same way now. Users multimodal devices be able provide input speech, handwriting keystrokes output presented displays, pre-recorded synthetic speech/audio tactile mechanisms vibrators Braille strips. Application developers be able provide effective user interface modes user Examples result increasingly capable networks, devices, speech recognition technology, number existing multimodal applications, especially mobile applications, rapidly accelerating: Multimodal Voice Search integrating GUI speech Voice control mobile devices Address input GPS systems Multimodal in-car systems accessing navigation audio/visual control Note almost multimodal applications have appeared last years. Many are based proprietary platforms technologies, so standardization multimodal interfaces needed global interoperability. Learn More mission Multimodal Interaction Activity develop open standards enable following vision: Extending Web allow multiple modes interaction: GUI, Speech, Vision, Pen, Gestures, Haptic interfaces, Anyone, Anywhere, device, time: Accessible user's preferred modes interaction services adapt device, user environmental conditions Visit Multimodal Interaction Activity home page.
