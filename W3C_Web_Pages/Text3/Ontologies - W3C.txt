Semantic Web, vocabularies define concepts relationships referred used describe represent area concern. Vocabularies are used classify terms be used particular application, characterize possible relationships, define possible constraints using terms. practice, vocabularies be very complex several thousands terms) very simple concepts only). clear division referred trend use word more complex, possibly quite formal collection terms, used such strict formalism not necessarily used only very loose sense. Vocabularies are basic building blocks inference techniques Semantic Web. are Vocabularies Used role vocabularies Semantic Web are help data integration example, ambiguities exist terms used different data sets, bit extra knowledge lead discovery new relationships. Consider, example, application ontologies field health care. Medical professionals use represent knowledge symptoms, diseases, treatments. Pharmaceutical companies use represent information drugs, dosages, allergies. Combining knowledge medical pharmaceutical communities patient data whole range intelligent applications such decision support tools search possible treatments; systems monitor drug efficacy possible side effects; tools support epidemiological research. type example use vocabularies organize knowledge. Libraries, museums, newspapers, government portals, enterprises, social networking applications, other communities manage large collections books, historical artifacts, news reports, business glossaries, blog entries, other items now use vocabularies, using standard formalisms, leverage power linked data. application complex vocabularies use. applications decide not use even small vocabularies, rely logic application program. application choose use very simple vocabularies described examples section let general Semantic Web environment use extra information make identification terms. applications need agreement common terminologies, rigor imposed logic system. Finally, applications need more complex ontologies complex reasoning procedures. requirements goals applications. satisfy different needs, W3C offers large palette techniques describe define different forms vocabularies standard format. include RDF RDF Schemas, Simple Knowledge Organization System Web Ontology Language Rule Interchange Format choice different technologies depend complexity rigor required specific application. Examples general example help. bookseller want integrate data coming different publishers. data be imported common RDF model, eg, using converters publishers’ databases. However, database use term other use term make integration complete, extra definition be added RDF data, describing fact relationship described same extra piece information fact, vocabulary ontology), extremely simple more complex case application need more detailed ontology part extra information. include formal description authors are be uniquely identified US setting, referring unique social security number), terms used particular application relate other datasets Web Wikipedia geographic information), term be related terms etc. Learn More Semantic Web community list books W3C Wiki page. books are introductory nature others are conference proceedings textbook address more advanced topics. Details recent upcoming Semantic Web related talks, given W3C Staff, staff W3C Offices, members W3C Working Groups are available separately; slides are usually publicly available.
