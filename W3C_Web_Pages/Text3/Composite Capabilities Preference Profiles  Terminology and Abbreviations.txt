Table Contents Terminology Abbreviations References Terminology key words NOT," NOT," document are be interpreted described RFC following terms are used document. Anonymization Hiding identity user security precaution. Assurance origin Information provided receiver message be certain origin message. assurance not be sufficient convince other party origin message.) Assurance receipt Information provided sender message be certain message was delivered intended recipient. not necessarily proof receipt. Attributes CC/PP attribute data elements describing profile denoted RDF property. CC/PP attribute associated value list values resources. Authentication communication process definite tamper-proof information identity communicating party. Authorization Permission view modify data resource, perform other action. Authorization usually granted identified entity, thus authentication party performing action. CC/PP Repository server stores user agent profile profile segments persistently form be referenced incorporated profile. CC/PP repository typically Web server CC/PP profiles profile segments response HTTP requests. Cacheable data resource said be data resource property sever determine cached resource matches request similar resource. Cache storage area used server proxy store data resources have been retrieved created response request. new request data resource received, server proxy respond cached version instead retrieving creating new copy. Capability attribute sender receiver receiver) ability generate process particular type message content. See also Channel security form security confidentiality) given communication channel, regardless information transferred channel. security thus provided end-points channel only. Client entity original compositor CC/PP profile. Confidentiality Protecting content message unauthorized disclosure. Content Generation purpose specification, generation" generating content appropriate user agent profile request using user agent profile input dynamic content generation engine. XSL style sheets document are used tailor document user agent profile request. Content Negotiation mechanism selecting appropriate representation servicing request. representation entities response be negotiated error responses). Content Selection purpose specification, selection" selecting appropriate document list possible choices variants matching document profile user agent profile request. Content Provider server content response request. Data Resource data object be transferred network. Data resources be available multiple representations multiple languages, data formats, size, resolutions) vary other ways. Document purpose specification, content supplied response request. Using definition, be collection smaller turn part greater Document Profile Document profiles offer means characterize features appropriate given categories user agents. instance, profile include support style sheets, vector graphics scripting, be restricted tags HTML Document profiles be used servers select document variants developed different user agent categories. be used determine transformations apply such variants are not available. Content developers use document profiles ensure web sites be rendered intended. Dynamic Content Content generated response request. be used content changing environmental factors such time stock quotes) place nearby gas stations) Feature Functional property device entity. Gateway Software capable bridging disparate network protocols. purposes specification, protocol bridging functionality, exist stand-alone gateway be co-located proxy origin server. Hint suggestion preference particular option. option strongly recommended, use not required. Integrity Procedures applied ensure information not corrupted transit. Different integrity procedures protect accidental intentional corruption data. Machine Understandable Data described tags associate meaning data tag describe author document), allowing data be searched combined not just displayed. Namespace qualifier added XML tag ensure uniqueness XML elements. Negotiate Content Message content been selected content negotiation. Negotiation Metadata Information exchanged sender receiver message content negotiation order determine variant be transferred. Non-repudiation term been subject much dispute. Broadly speaking, process party communication subsequently denying communication took place, denying content communication. Sometimes term used purely technical sense generation data dependent communication content) sometimes legal sense evidence be sustained court law). Non-Repudiation Origin ability receiver verify source information. Non-Repudiation Receipt ability sender verify intended recipient received information. Non-variant Content form/format content being sent not depend receiver's capabilities preferences Object security form security confidentiality) item data object), regardless communication channel passed. Object security apply data passed several different data channels succession, be used protect message addressing other transfer-related information. Origin Server Software respond requests delivering appropriate content error messages. origin server receive requests WSP HTTP. Application programs executing origin server deliver content tailored accordance CC/PP be found provided profile. purpose specification, server" content generation capabilities, physically exist stand-alone Web server be co-located proxy gateway. Preference attribute sender receiver receiver) preference generate process particular type message content even are possible. Privacy Preventing unintended unauthorized disclosure information person. Such information be contained message, also be inferred patterns communication; e.g. communications happen, types resource accessed, parties withwhom communication etc. Profile instance schema describe capabilities specific device network. profile need not have attributes identified vocabulary/schema. Proof receipt, Proof delivery Information provided sender message prove subsequently third party message was delivered intended recipient. proof not necessarily be legally sustainable.) Proxy Software HTTP requests forwards request origin server way upstream proxy) using HTTP. proxy response origin server forwards requesting client. providing forwarding functions, proxy modify request response provide other value-added functions. purposes specification, request/response forwarding functionality, exist stand-alone HTTP proxy be co-located gateway origin server. RDF Resource object element being described RDF expressions resource. RDF resource identified URI. Receiver system component program) message. Receiver-initiated Transmission message transmission requested eventual receiver message. Sometimes described messaging. E.g. HTTP GET operation. Schema RDF schema resources constitute particular unchanging versions RDF vocabulary point time. used provide semantic information organization relationship) interpretation statements RDF data model. not include values associated attributes. Security set procedures applied data communications ensure information transferred exactly sender receiver intend, other way. Security generally breaks down integrity, authentication, confidentiality Privacy. Sender system component program) message. Sender-initiated transmission message transmission invoked sender message. Sometimes described messaging. E.g. sending email. User individual group individuals acting single entity. user further qualified entity uses device request content resource server. User agent program, such browser, running device acts user's behalf. Users use different user agents different times. User Agent Profile Capabilities preference Information pertaining capabilities device, operating network environment, users personal preferences receiving content resource. Variant several possible representations data resource. Variant Content form/format content being sent receiver's capabilities preferences Vocabulary collection attributes adequately describe CC/PP. vocabulary associated schema.
