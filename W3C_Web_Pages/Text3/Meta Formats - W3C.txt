Examples metaformats are XML, RDF JSON. Metaformats offer advantages creating custom syntax language be processed generic tools, languages use be understood people have learned metaformat. Metaformats usually have schema language be used define describe vocabulary uses metaformat, query transformation languages be used access information documents use metaformat. XML? XML simple standardised way serialize information representable labelled trees annotations cross-references, allowing free choice markup vocabulary. not only makes well-suited human-authored documents, particularly given facility mixed content marked-up text) built-in support Unicode, also means useful syntax kinds machine-to-machine data transfer. XHTML, Docbook DITA are examples XML-based languages primarily intended documents; machine-to-machine uses include Atom, UPnP networked device discovery) AEMP construction equipment).There are several schema languages XML, including XML Schema RELAX NG, enable XML-based languages be validated. are also generic methods querying transforming XML XPath XSLT, XQuery, XML Processing pipelines. RDF? RDF language designed expression arbitrary information arbitrary things. variant surface syntaxes including Turtle RDFa, latter allowing embedding HTML thus promoting machine readability information found HTML documents. RDF useful expressing graph structured information entity linkable URL thus core data model Semantic Web. Common RDF vocabularies, be used RDF syntax, are Dublin Core Terms, FOAF, SKOS, schema.org. RDF vocabularies be described RDF Schemas OWL Ontologies. are primarily used inference: deduce new information data expressed RDF. More flexible reasoning RDF be described using RIF. Data stored RDF stores, known triplestores, be queried updated using SPARQL. JSON? JSON metaformat useful expressing tree-based data structures. JSON's key benefit tersely kinds data structures commonly used programming languages, particularly Javascript, makes very easy create consume. JSON rarely used declarative schema usually processed being parsed native data structures used particular programming language. However, there are several query languages currently development, including JSON Path, Jaql, JSONiq.
