New Rich Internet Applications render custom widgets, modeling rich desktop components perform UI updates having reload entire page much graphical user interface Legacy GUI accessibility frameworks address issues comprehensive accessibility application programming interface infrastructure foster interoperability assistive technologies. APIs constitute contract applications assistive technologies, such screen readers, enable access rich dynamic content appropriate semantics needed produce usable alternative. such contract modern RIAs assistive technologies, creating accessibility gap persons disabilities. Unfortunately, HTML other markup not provide adequate markup support accessible dynamic content. now, W3C WAI discouraged use JavaScript Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Checkpoint number W3C initiatives are underway address problem using declarative markup approach. roadmap designed create bridge fix interoperability problem assistive technologies now incorporating appropriate meta data current XHTML markup support today's accessibility API. incorporate advanced accessibility features, originally designed, technologies XHTML2. intent XHTML make enablement Web applications documents easier authors. roadmap create cross-cutting technologies XHTML authors incorporate markup describe GUI widgets document structures aide assistive technology vendors providing accessible, usable solutions. W3C WAI PF working group work User Agent manufacturers assistive technology vendors ensure working solution. Problem Aspects traditional HTML make accessible support dynamic content difficult: Accessibility abstracting semantics content presentation information. Extracting semantic cues current HTML content typically unreliable. Today, semantics are limited tag elements names. HTML content be repurposed presentation formatting providing way convey semantic information. common example tables used format content rather style sheets. combined script CSS, HTML be repurposed create dynamic custom components providing means convey semantic information native accessibility architectures designed support dynamic GUI content. HTML ability attach meaningful metadata document structure. HTML elements commonly used repurposing produce custom components are not keyboard accessible. Authors JavaScript generated content do not want limit using standard tag elements define actual user interface element such tables, ordered lists, etc. Rather, make extensive use tag elements such DIVs dynamically apply UI use style sheets dynamic content changes. HTML DIV tags provide semantic information. example, authors define DIV start pop-up menu even ordered list. However, HTML mechanism Identify role DIV pop-up menu Alert assistive technology elements have focus Convey accessibility property information, such pop-up menu collapsed expanded Define actions be formed element other device-dependent means event handler type onclick, etc.) short JavaScript needs accessibility architecture canwrite such solution be mapped accessibilityframeworks native platform user agent. Figure AccessibilityInteroperability DOM Node JavaScript Figure typical DOM node ina Model-View-Controller architecture. node, data, include semantic information, separatedfrom user interface presentation, Here, thedocument element managed user agent based defaultbehavior element. user agent's default behavior thedocument element forms controller. Placed DOM nodeand assistive technology box containing contractprovided user agent assistive technology. dataincludes typical accessibility information found theaccessibility API many accessible platforms GUIs(role, state, caret, selection, text, hypertext, namedescription, parent/child information, parent/childinformation, relations). HTML other W3C markup, theaccessibility information provided solely element's tag name-and accessibility attributes map tag--provides. example, accessible role table table. author accessible description assigning title attribute. Figure AccessibilityInteroperability DOM node JavaScript Figure shows same DOM node providedin Figure JavaScript acting new controller.JavaScript overrides default user agent behavior DOMnode. data, content, style response toevents caused user interaction produce custom widgets. Inthis situation default accessibility information longervalid therefore contract now invalid. Figure showsthe contract asterisks front role, state, actions,value, event changes, relations. asterisks representpotential accessibility errors gaps base markup. Thesegaps result author's inability provide new semanticdata needed support contract. Executive Summary clear problem statement author doesnot have ability provide appropriate accessibilityinformation markup support accessibility APIs platform. problem not limited HTML. toother markup, including SVG. WAI Protocols Formats working group address problem middleware application layer web content delivered desktop browsers. desktop browsers, be creating common extensions HTML XHTML called Roles, States, Properties Module Accessible Rich Internet Applications goal make standard features HTML W3C also working XHTML middleware solutions strong focus declarative markup. Middleware developers prefer operate well-formed markup due common dependency merge document fragments. growing focus W3C standards work use declarative markup need JavaScript. New work being done XForms XHTML targets incorporation accessibility features declarative markup language. added benefit reducing enablement burden middleware authors leveraging existing accessibility information stored markup. Ultimately, middleware, need convert content traditional markup supported today's browsers.

Data models are inconsistent. Accessibility bolted rather being built Accessibility solutions remain more device-dependent be. Heavy accessibility lifting done author line withthe way JavaScript used. use declarative markup tight integration accessibility application framework, produce more consistent cross-platform solutions support accessibility reduce enablement efforts author. time there are new standards forming new application middleware incorporate key accessibility features needed accessibility. XML Events Events] author provide purpose event handlers allowing people disabilities ability know happen action performed, such making purchase. XForms new forms specification semantic meta data be stored directly form. example, ARIA required attribute was derived XForms data model property. using standard XForms data model, many accessibility properties, found ARIA, easily be extracted simply following XForms data model. XForms also device independent events, declarative event handlers covering many use cases found JavaScript accessibility information actions be performed be automatically derived. XForms also support labeling elements, hints, help information form elements be provided platform accessibility API. XHTML Access Module element used conjunction other XHTML modules, more robust accessibility replacement HTML access key.
