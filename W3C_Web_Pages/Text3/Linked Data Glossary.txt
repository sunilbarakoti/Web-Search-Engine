Linked Data Platform use REST API accessing, updating, creating deleting resources servers. See also Linked Data Principles Provide common API data Web more convenient many separately differently designed APIs published individual data suppliers. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor Web initiator Linked Data project, proposed following principles Linked Data based: Use URIs name things; Use HTTP URIs so things be referred looked up people user agents; someone looks up URI, provide useful information, using open Web standards such RDF, SPARQL; Include links other related things using URIs publishing Web.

Linkset collection RDF links datasets. Machine Readable Data Data formats be readily parsed computer programs access proprietary libraries. example, CSV, TSV RDF formats are machine readable, PDF Microsoft Excel are not. Creating publishing data following Linked Data principles search engines humans find, access re-use data. Once information found, computer programs re-use data need custom scripts manipulate content. Publishing machine readable data using Linked Data principles human machine readable version. example, Wikipedia Web page color Red. DBpedia, database containing structured content contained Wikipedia, Linked Data client look up changing appending appropriate file extension. curl http://dbpedia.org/data/Red.ttl Message basic unit HTTP communication. structured sequence octets matching syntax defined HTTP Message transmitted connection.
