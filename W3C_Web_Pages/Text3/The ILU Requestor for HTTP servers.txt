Table Contents Introduction Requirements Requester architecture Detailed Description Current Status Implementation Examples Interfaces Performance Analysis Outstanding Issues Future Plans Alternatives References Appendices Author's Info Introduction Applications deployed World-Wide Web often involve HTTP server integrated legacy information system, custom informationsystem. Common Gateway Interface, CGI, most widely deployedmechanism integrating HTTP servers other information systems, butstudies have shown design not scale performance demands contemporaryapplications.Microsoft states applications API arefive times fasterthan CGI applications. Moreover, CGI applications do not run httpd process. additionto performance penalty, means CGI applications modifiythe behavior httpd's internal operations, such logging authorization.Finally, CGI viewed asecurity issueby server operators, due connection user-level shell. current solution use httpd API, such asApache orNetscape.By using API, have performance increase load decrease running application inthe httpd process, rather starting new process request. Also,the API httpd's own behavior, allowing modify itsoperation. fact, servers Apache implement large portions theirfunctionality, such ISMAP handling logging, asmodules. Unfortunately, API benefits come price. Running user-writtenmodule httpd process leads possible reliability concerns. instance,when developing requesters, early code regularly lead core dumpsfrom unhandled errors, well memory leaks. Also, most current servers useeither multiple pre-forked subprocesses separate threads new request. Thus, applications change state, such simple counter script, have dataconcurrency issues are burden programmer solve. Most importantly, API route casual CGI programmer. Ina recentsurvey, Perl beat C total votes. appearsthat possibilities language-choice C-based API mechanism arerestrictive. Finally, portability CGI applications httpd implementationto be lost API strategy. API differentsyntax, authors be forced know API beforehand. Thus, APIscould become instruments used vendors ensure market retention. elimination scripting API strategy serious issue. Webservices are usually built using scripting languages such Perl, Python,Tcl, Visual Basic, Rexx, etc. be case web appsare frequently: quick dirty complex data relationships short-lived written casual programmers essence, genre CGI applications are usually complex enough usetools good rapid prototyping, rarely get prototype stageand C. address generation server-extending, developed mechanismbased uniform interface specification HTTP. theHTTP.isl. basing extension mechanismon distributed object protocol ILU, get performance featuresof API strategy shown portability simplicity ofCGI.

ILU Requester Nutshell Performance API Features API Portability CGI Simplicity CGI Bridge distributed objects Requirements Requester strategy have listed problems current CGI/API situation. Andwe have described ILU Requester architecture. are requirements,and are preferred possibilities? Requirements portable platforms vendors based well-understood industry standards infrastructure uses freely-available, high-quality code base active sustainable development wide choice language not language-based) significant performance win scaleable N clients N servers non-blocking threaded servers Preferences configurable servers adding methods HTTP, implementingthem erase bugs) designed eventual absorption server's code base asa common encapsulation designed also eventually-encapsulated browser objectruntime available messaging standard interfaces, such site catalogue, authorizer, logger,gatherer, broker Detailed Description have implemented ILU Requester several platforms, have extendeddevelopment include other interested parties. First, give somebackground, then description. Background December were tasked developing complex WWW service.This service necessitated dynamic language, had state. Yet, wereforced use CGI. Thus, made first implementation using long-runningprocess managed state using dynamic language(Python), script message hit. time, found were inventing own client/server protocol.For other reasons, started looking using ILU manageinteractionsbetween processes. Thus, CGI script got surrogate reference anencapsulation stateful system. Still, had performance penalty CGI. April wrotea patch Apache embedded ILU runtime. had access objects registered URL constructs. served severalproduction systems fall. point, started refer tothis embedded ILU module requester. August, version Apache was released had API, so startedreworking requester use October had related requesterfor Netsite working Unix partially NT. December, based anew draftof HTTP spec, consolidated feature sets, wrote HTTPISL was comprehensive respect new specification. Also,we started work ILU January year, started standardizing Python creating online services. developed ISL installingobject-based Authorizers Loggers httpd. Case Study: Broadcast Also January, released first major product based architecturecalled Broadcast.This Web-based chat application had primary goal: be veryfast very highly-loaded conditions. design choices were: Perl-based CGI product was replacing started life perl-based chat. became very popular, least popular enough many simultaneous users wouldload system up too much. suffered startup cost interpreter,the cost reading state disk, design issues multipleprocesses changing state. C-based CGI Same above, moved C. Still faced problems stateand concurrency. CGI-based requester-daemon service choice solving problem state be have long-runningserver process managed state chat, have skinny requestersthat message chat server CGI socket. design problemof reincarnating state request. Also, DBMS-like functionfor modifying state, everything process. However, there still cost starting up CGI requester hit,and socket create/teardown issue. Also, have invented nice littleclient-server system protocol, other. Plus, protocol hasto be interpreted wire, using custom parser. Finally, chat daemon be equipped concurrency, else bottleneck. RPC service more elegant version chat daemon strategy be use RPC tothe chat server, CGI requester API-based requester. Thiswould replace custom protocol, allow API-based requester keep connectionsopen. other hand, have produced system procedure-oriented,rather thanobject-oriented. chose use ILU Requester make generic calls publishedobjects represented chat site's components. allowed have verylow latency avoiding startup costs), expose OO design chat implementation. design choice was valid. Performance fantastic, andload low. Also, using requester strategy, now have many new possibilitesfor application partitioning. Finally, using APIScripting infrastructure, are able add new features very coherent fashion. Description alluded above, entire system based ILU. get language-independence, cross-process communication, andplatform-independence. goal add abstract object interface httpd uniformway. wrote interface HTTP behaviorof HTTP transaction. then implement interface C mappingit semantics particular httpd's API. implementation iscalled requester, httpd mechanism passingcertain incoming requests ILU published object. architecture mimics interaction browser httpd using same concepts HTTP. instance, information contained request mapped Request type interfacespecification. requested object Resource, result operation Resource Response. Request Response are types defined interface. Fortunately, uniform, abstract ISL, services writedo not have know anything semantics server API.In fact, be possible skip httpd altogether, communicatedirectly published object. objects do canhave multiple representations, communicate HTTP requests, ILUrequests, other request structure. writing service, therefore, have do publish anobject based skeleton code generated interface.Pretty standard stuff here. Then, published object listed inthe httpd's configuration file, incoming requests matching certain URIform be sent requester, make ILU call tothe published object. Also, possible map requester remotely-published objects using ILU's String Binding Handle mechanism. makes possible bridge httpd services available other platforms. Future ILUmechanisms make process easier. Current Status Implementation writing, have solid requesters based ILU forNetsite Apache. have been tested others, reviewed foroptimizations, passed simple memory leak testers, documented.We are making distributions freely available source, binaryform. Currently, requesters are known work fine Solaris, Digital Unix,Linux, AIX, BSDI. Additionally, have preliminary support NT. Full support waiting finish up work threading ILU. Finally, ILU been reported work OS/2, there work onand Apache implementation platform. threading issue become increasingly important build moresophisticated systems, especially want have common ORB. However, systems such Netsite Microsoft's IIS NT, well Spyglass' server, required requester. platforms service incoming request thread,rather passing request isolated process. Thread-safeing therequester thus becoming requirement. have just added support aliasing multiply-published objects requester. instance, make request info@system,and have map" several published objects. mainlyfor performance increase read-only situations. Note be subsumed ILU work multicast. area are working making object systems easier use. have just added HTTP header returned, stating version requester version. are adding support discoverableinterface, using standard built requester. objectwill return catalogue information config file directives, attemptto contact ILU servers listed config file get implemented. API Scripting Making httpd able call distributed objects only half system: have objects be called. have intended system replace CGI server-extension mechanism. do be nearly easy create services CGIis currently. have been working infrastructure publishing requester-capable objects called API Scripting. creating services, are focusing Python, building up atoolset components. have made parts toolset available,and have released demonstration programs load testing modules.Based Python toolset requester, are fielding high-performanceInternet services commercial use. instance, here very simple script Python object echoes contents request: good module docstrings.This very simple script subclasses Resource, blanks, echoes incoming Requests. then object main loop."""import iluimport wwworb	# toolsetclass ILUforDummies(wwworb.Resource): def GET(self,request,connect): request = wwworb.Request(request) response = wwworb.Response(`request`) return response POST = GET# Create ILU serverilu.CreateServer('paul.demos')# Now, create instance class, passing parameter# name published object.nitwit = ILUforDummies('dumb')print nitwit.IluSBH()ilu.RunMainLoop() Note there are really only necessary lines put realm CGI ease use. step make highly-concurrent systems available Python. do are working ILU team thread iluPrmodule. work related work threading ILU kernel. have emerging development group, infrastructurefor documentation, tutorials, bug reports, etc. Examples Interfaces Currently, have stabilized HTTP interface, feel accuratelyrepresents interaction browser client way usefulfor published objects httpd. Therefore, are now focusing onproblem-specific interfaces. First, have discoverable interface online services.For instance, be able go requester-enabled site, senda request info@root published object, get inventory ofthat site. contents inventory vary, support set minimumoperations, extend, change. things aninterfaceallows do time. discoverable interface being worked are other interfacesthat have already rolled out. Authorizer ISL Most scripting" services involve persistent Python objects receive requests ILU main loop. services needsome type Access Control List mechanism However, really don't want interface external, httpd-controlled,single-filesystem-based password file. API-based servers have modules already allow store user authentication information SQL table. Yet, already have users defined object system. Moreover, want have someinstance-based authorization mechanism. extend ACL-capabilities httpd, wrote Authorizer interface, implemented APIs support. Thus, accesses toprotected URIs are mapped object call, operation allowed identity. Logger ISL area wanted standardize was intelligent loggingmechanism. Currently, there Common Log File format writing todisk. However, wanted something more structured more dynamic. Thus,we wrote interface logging, mapped httpd's API functions,and created installable logging facility. smart implementation couldpublish object registered successful unsuccessful requeststo document ILU-based requests. there error, decidewhether send page someone's beeper. requests, takethe incoming data structure, write parts miniSQL table. wanted extend httpd's logging facilities new interestingways. instance, wanted do processing take special actions ifan error was raised. Also, wanted investigate logging Unix httpd Windows-based personal DBMS Microsoft Access. do made interface loggging, implemented support. mapping forces httpd run object call duringlogging events. interface very simple; just Request object LoggerObject asynchronous method. Onecould then subtype there do more interesting, platform-specific things. Stanford Digital Library Common Object Services Stanford Digital Library team produced interfaces implementationsfor CORBA-typeCommon Object Services Common Object Services are objects groupsof objects provide basic requirements most objects need orderto function distributed environment. services are designed begeneric; do not depend type client object type data passed. Note:this hard do ILU there concept Object type. Other Interfaces are other good candidates interfaces. instance, Harvestsystem own protocol collecting indexing information, doingsearches. interface was written, perhaps be moved thisarchitecture. have started other standard interfaces, such Data Accessinterface OLE interface Python). though, are not necessarilyrelated ILU Requester, are thus scope paper. Performance Analysis be apparent architecture good performance.However, felt performance numbers were important, so cameup performance-testing program, regimen exercise test, used Sparc running Solaris Mb testing client,and Alpha Mb running Digital Unix testing server. testprogram was written Python, used httplib thread modules tomake concurrent requests. server was running Netsite, using requesterand ILU had Netsite configured use up processes. then ran series URLs series tests:a latency test throughput test. latency test sent series requestson thread, test response time. throughput test dispatched samenumber requests several simultaneous threads, test concurrent use.

Python interpreter used CGI scripts was very small. removed nearly everything Modules setup, did not link threads source startup time problems Digital Unix). used Python ILU Thus, comparison Python CGI Python Scripting". tests are simple echo string, slightly-computational parsing incoming information. Obviously, real-world application, files have read, marshals loaded, databases connected-to, tilt scales API scripting, state always memory. following, HPS hits second, SPH seconds hit, SD standard deviation.

Thus, hit effectively done faster. Analysis Looking latency tests, see HTML simple CGI scripts are same HPS. simple scripts don't parse environment, thus do calculation. simple1.py script parse environment imports module rise latency. Yet, API Scripting apps stay same level HTML simple CGI, even parsing environment. throughput test, reference point index.html file shows 10-thread request just five-fold bump throughput.
