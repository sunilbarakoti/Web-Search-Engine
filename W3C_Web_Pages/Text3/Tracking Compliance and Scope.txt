Acknowledgements B. References B.1 Normative references Scope Do Not Track designed provide users simple preference expression mechanism allow limit online tracking globally selectively. specification compliance requests user agents access general browsable Web; have user interface satisfies requirements Determining User Preference specification; implement specification, including mechanisms communicating tracking status, user-granted exception mechanism. Issue Description scope specification Definitions User user individual human. user agent software accesses online resources, not user specific knowledge particular request, request user." User Agent term user agent various client programs capable initiating HTTP requests, including not limited browsers, spiders robots), command-line tools, native applications, mobile apps Network Interaction network interaction single HTTP request corresponding response(s): more interim responses single final response. User Action user action deliberate action user, configuration, invocation, selection, initiate network interaction. Selection link, submission form, reloading page are examples user actions. Subrequest subrequest network interaction not directly initiated user action. example, initial response hypermedia format embedded references stylesheets, images, frame sources, onload actions cause browser, depending capabilities configuration, perform corresponding set automated subrequests fetch references using additional network interactions. Party party natural person, legal entity, set legal entities share common owner(s), common controller(s), group identity easily discoverable user. Common branding providing list affiliates available link resource party DNT practices are examples ways provide discoverability. Service Provider outsourced service provider considered be same party client service provider: acts only data processor behalf client; data only be accessed used directed client; independent right use share data necessary ensure integrity, security, correct operation service being provided; contract place mandates requirements. Issue Service Provider name requirements First Party respect given user action, first party party user interact, more network interactions, result making action. Merely hovering muting, pausing, closing given piece content not constitute user's intent interact party. cases, resource Web be jointly controlled more distinct parties. parties considered first party user reasonably expect communicate accessing resource. example, prominent co-branding resource lead user expect multiple parties are responsible content functionality. Third Party data collected result more network interactions resulting user's action, third party party other user, first party user action, service provider acting behalf user first party. Deidentified Data deidentified party: achieved reasonable level justified confidence data be used infer information about, otherwise be linked particular consumer, computer, other device; make attempt re-identify data; contractually downstream recipients attempting re-identify data. Issue Definition de-identified previously, unlinkable) data Tracking Tracking collection data regarding particular user's activity multiple distinct contexts retention, use, sharing data derived activity context occurred. context set resources are controlled same party jointly controlled set parties. Collect, Use, Share, Facilitate party data received network interaction data remains partyâ€™s control network interaction complete. party uses data party processes data purpose other storage merely forwarding party. party shares data transfers copy data other party. party facilitates other partyâ€™s collection data such party collect data engage tracking. Graduated Response graduated response methodology action taken proportional size problem risk trying be mitigated. context document, term used describe increase collection data user interaction response specific problem party become aware such increase fraudulent activity originating particular network IP address range resulting increased logging data relating interactions specific range IP addresses opposed increased logging users general. Note Only used security, overlap explanation there. Delete definition let be defined only place used? User Agent Compliance Issue user agent compliance requirements; connections TPE Note Much duplicative requirements specification. harmonize example: removing section just including normative reference summary requirements; reducing section requirements user agent MUST offer users minimum alternative choices Do Not Track general preference: unset DNT: user agent MAY offer third alternative choice: DNT: user's choice DNT:1 DNT:0, tracking preference enabled; otherwise, tracking preference not enabled. user agent MUST have default tracking preference unset enabled). User agents web sites are responsible determining user experience tracking preference controlled. User agents web sites MUST ensure tracking preference choices are communicated users clearly accurately shown time place tracking preference choice made available user. User agents web sites MUST ensure tracking preference choices describe parties DNT MUST make available brief neutral explanatory text provide more detailed information DNT functionality. text MUST indicate tracking preference communicated, limits collection use web viewing data certain advertising other purposes; DNT enabled, data still be collected used certain purposes, description such purposes; user affirmatively particular party collect use data web viewing activities, enabling DNT not limit collection use party. User agents web sites MUST obtain explicit choice made user setting controls affect tracking preference expression. user agent MUST transmit tracking preference according specification. Implementations HTTP are not control user MUST NOT generate modify tracking preference. First Party Compliance respect given user action, first party action DNT:1 signal MAY collect use data received network interactions. customizing content, services advertising respect user actions. first party given user action MUST NOT share data network interactions third parties action are prohibited collecting data network interactions recommendation. Data interaction MAY be shared withh service providers acting behalf first party. first party given user action MAY elect follow rules defined recommendation third parties. Note Given WG decision ISSUE-241, first party action indicate user electing follow third-party rules? suggest using other tracking status code? Issue Definition what/whether limitations data first parties Third Party Compliance Issue Use third-party compliance third party given user action DNT:1 signal related network interaction: party MUST NOT collect, share, use data related interaction; party MUST NOT use data previous network interactions was third party. third party given user action MAY nevertheless collect use such data user explicitly-granted exception, described data collected set permitted uses described data de-identified defined recommendation. Outside permitted uses explicitly-granted exceptions listed third party given user action MUST collect, share, associate related network interactions identifiers identify specific user, user agent, device. example, third party not require unique user identifiers permitted uses MUST NOT place unique identifier cookies other browser-based local storage mechanisms. third party given user action disregards DNT signal MUST indicate so user agent, using response mechanism defined recommendation. scope specification control short-term, transient collection use data, so long data not shared third party not used build profile user otherwise alter individual userâ€™s user experience current network interaction. example, contextual customization ads shown part same network interaction not restricted DNT:1 signal. Issue additionally permit logs are retained short enough period? Issue Definitions collection retention transience network interaction Third Party Geolocation Compliance third party given user action DNT:1 signal related network interaction, then party MUST NOT use geolocation data interaction level more granular postal code, specific consent been granted use more granular location data. Issue Limitations geolocation third parties General Principles Permitted collection use data third parties given user action permitted, receipt DNT:1 network interaction, enumerated Different permitted uses differ permitted items data collection, retention times, consequences. cases, collection use data be reasonably necessary proportionate achieve purpose specifically permitted; unreasonable disproportionate collection, retention, use are not â€œpermitted usesâ€?. Secondary party MUST NOT use data collected permitted uses purposes other permitted uses datum was permitted be collected. Data Minimization, Retention Transparency Data collected party permitted uses MUST be limited data reasonably necessary such permitted uses. Such data MUST NOT be retained longer proportionate reasonably necessary such permitted uses. party MUST provide public transparency time periods data collected permitted uses are retained. party MAY enumerate different retention periods different permitted uses. Data MUST NOT be used permitted use once data retention period permitted use expired. there are remaining permitted uses given data, data MUST be deleted de-identified. party data permitted use MUST make reasonable data minimization efforts ensure only data necessary permitted use retained, MUST NOT rely unique identifiers alternative solutions are reasonably available. Issue Limitations use unique identifiers Issue Data Minimization, Retention Transparency use rather section? Personalization party data permitted use MUST NOT use data alter specific user's online experience based multi-site activity, specifically permitted Reasonable Security party data permitted use MUST use reasonable technical organizational safeguards prevent further processing data retained permitted uses. physical separation data maintained permitted uses not required, best practices be place ensure technical controls ensure access limitations information security. party ensure access use data retained permitted uses auditable. Permitted Issue specify retention periods transparency) permitted uses? Frequency Capping Regardless tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected, retained used limit number times user particular advertisement, often called frequency capping, long data retained do not reveal userâ€™s browsing history. party MUST NOT construct profiles users user behaviors based ad frequency history, otherwise alter userâ€™s experience. Financial Logging Regardless tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected used billing auditing related current network interaction concurrent transactions. include counting ad impressions unique visitors, verifying positioning quality ad impressions auditing compliance other standards. Security Regardless tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected used extent reasonably necessary detect security incidents, protect service malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, illegal activity, prosecute responsible such activity, provided such data not used operational behavior personalization) reasonably necessary protect service institute graduated response. feasible, graduated response detected security incident preferred widespread data collection. example be recording use given IP address range, regardless DNT signal, party seeing coordinated attack service click fraud) IP address range. Similarly, attack shared other identifiable fingerprint, such combination User Agent other protocol information, party retain logs interactions matching fingerprint be determined are not associated such attack such retention longer necessary support prosecution. Debugging Regardless tracking preference expressed, data MAY be collected, retained used debugging purposes identify repair errors impair existing intended functionality. Audience Measurement Note Note: open question group audience measurement be addressed; see issue Issue audience measurement adressed DNT? use otherwise) User-Granted Exceptions user DNT:0 signal, user expressing preference personalized experience. signal explicit consent data collection, retention, processing, disclosure, use recipient signal provide personalized experience user. recommendation places restrictions data collected requests received DNT:0. party MAY engage practices otherwise proscribed recommendation user given explicit informed consent. consent MAY be obtained API defined companion document, party MAY obtain band consent disregard Do Not Track preference using different technology. party relying band consent disregard Do Not Track preference, party MUST indicate consent user agent described companion document. Interaction Existing User Privacy Controls Multiple systems be setting, sending, receiving DNT opt-out signals same time. result, be important ensure industry web browser vendors are same page respect honoring user choices circumstances signals" be received. general principle, more specific settings override less specific settings. DNT Signal Opt-Out: Treat DNT unset DNT:1 Signal Opt-Out: Treat DNT: Opt-Out DNT:1 Signal: Treat DNT: Opt-Out DNT User-Granted Exception: Treat DNT: site; DNT User-Granted Exception honored Issue Interaction existing privacy controls Issue Conditions dis-regarding not) DNT signals Unknowing Collection party data violation recommendation, MUST, reasonably feasible, delete de-identify data earliest practical opportunity, even was previously unaware such information practices reasonable efforts understand information practices. Issue Requirements unknowing collection, retention use Legal Compliance anything recommendation, party MAY collect, use, share data required comply applicable laws, regulations, judicial processes.
