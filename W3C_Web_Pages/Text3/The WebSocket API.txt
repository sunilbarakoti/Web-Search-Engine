CLOSED value connection been closed not be opened. object created readyState be set CONNECTING extensions attribute initially return empty string. WebSocket connection established, value change, defined extensions attribute returns extensions selected server, only ever be empty string.) protocol attribute initially return empty string. WebSocket connection established, value change, defined protocol attribute returns subprotocol selected server, be used conjunction array form constructor's second argument perform subprotocol negotiation. close() method run following steps: method's first argument present not integer equal range throw InvalidAccessError exception abort steps. method's second argument present, then run substeps: Let raw reason be method's second argument. Let Unicode reason be result converting raw reason sequence Unicode characters. Let reason be result encoding Unicode reason UTF-8. reason longer bytes, then throw SyntaxError exception abort steps. Run first matching steps following list: readyState attribute CLOSING CLOSED state Do nothing. connection already closing already closed. not already, close event eventually fire described WebSocket connection not yet established Fail WebSocket connection set readyState attribute's value CLOSING fail WebSocket connection algorithm close WebSocket connection algorithm, then WebSocket connection closed, fires close event described WebSocket closing handshake not yet been started Start WebSocket closing handshake set readyState attribute's value CLOSING first argument present, then status code use WebSocket Close message be integer given first argument. second argument also present, then reason be provided Close message status code. start WebSocket closing handshake algorithm eventually close WebSocket connection algorithm, then WebSocket connection closed, fires close event described Otherwise Set readyState attribute's value CLOSING WebSocket closing handshake started, eventually invoke close WebSocket connection algorithm, establish WebSocket connection closed, thus close event fire, described bufferedAmount attribute return number bytes application data text binary data) have been queued using send() last time event loop started executing task, had not yet been transmitted network. thus text sent execution current task, regardless user agent able transmit text asynchronously script execution.) not include framing overhead incurred protocol, buffering done operating system network hardware. connection closed, attribute's value only increase call send() method number not reset once connection closes). simple example, bufferedAmount attribute used ensure updates are sent rate update 50ms, network handle rate, rate network handle, too fast. var socket = new WebSocket('ws://game.example.com:12010/updates');socket.onopen = function setInterval(function() == socket.send(getUpdateData()); bufferedAmount attribute also be used saturate network sending data higher rate network handle, more careful monitoring value attribute time. WebSocket object created, binaryType IDL attribute be set string getting, return last value was set setting, new value string string then set IDL attribute new value. Otherwise, throw SyntaxError exception. attribute authors control binary data exposed scripts. setting attribute binary data returned Blob form; setting returned ArrayBuffer form. User agents use hint handle incoming binary data: attribute set safe spool disk, set likely more efficient keep data memory. Naturally, user agents are encouraged use more subtle heuristics decide keep incoming data memory not, e.g. based big data common script change attribute last minute. latter aspect important particular quite possible attribute be changed user agent received data user agent fired event send(data) method data using connection. readyState attribute CONNECTING, throw InvalidStateError exception. Otherwise, user agent run appropriate set steps following list: argument string Let data be result converting data argument sequence Unicode characters. WebSocket connection established WebSocket closing handshake not yet started, then user agent send WebSocket Message comprised data using text frame opcode; data be sent, e.g. need be buffered buffer full, user agent close WebSocket connection prejudice. invocation method string argument not throw exception increase bufferedAmount attribute number bytes needed express argument UTF-8. argument Blob object WebSocket connection established, WebSocket closing handshake not yet started, then user agent send WebSocket Message comprised data using binary frame opcode; data be sent, e.g. need be buffered buffer full, user agent close WebSocket connection prejudice. data be sent raw data represented Blob object. invocation method Blob argument not throw exception increase bufferedAmount attribute size Blob object's raw data, bytes. argument ArrayBuffer object WebSocket connection established, WebSocket closing handshake not yet started, then user agent send WebSocket Message comprised data using binary frame opcode; data be sent, e.g. need be buffered buffer full, user agent close WebSocket connection prejudice. data be sent data stored buffer described ArrayBuffer object. invocation method ArrayBuffer argument not throw exception increase bufferedAmount attribute length ArrayBuffer bytes. argument ArrayBufferView object WebSocket connection established, WebSocket closing handshake not yet started, then user agent send WebSocket Message comprised data using binary frame opcode; data be sent, e.g. need be buffered buffer full, user agent close WebSocket connection prejudice. data be sent data stored section buffer described ArrayBuffer object ArrayBufferView object references. invocation method ArrayBufferView argument not throw exception increase bufferedAmount attribute length ArrayBufferView bytes. following are event handlers corresponding event handler event types) be supported, IDL attributes, objects implementing WebSocket interface: Event handler Event handler event type onopen open onmessage message onerror error onclose close Feedback protocol WebSocket connection established, user agent queue task run steps: Change readyState attribute's value OPEN Change extensions attribute's value extensions use, not null value. Change protocol attribute's value subprotocol use, not null value. Act user agent had received set-cookie-string consisting cookies set server's opening handshake, URL url given WebSocket() constructor. Fire simple event named open WebSocket object. WebSocket message been received type type data data, user agent queue task follow steps: readyState attribute's value not OPEN then abort steps. Let event be event uses MessageEvent interface, event type message, not bubble, not cancelable, default action. Initialize event's origin attribute Unicode serialization origin URL was passed WebSocket object's constructor. type data Text, then initialize event's data attribute data. type data Binary, binaryType set then initialize event's data attribute new Blob object data raw data. type data Binary, binaryType set then initialize event's data attribute new read-only ArrayBuffer object contents are data. Dispatch event WebSocket object. User agents are encouraged check perform steps efficiently run task, picking tasks other task queues prepare buffers not. example, binaryType attribute was set data arrived, user agent spooled data disk, just running task particular message script switched binaryType user agent want page data back RAM running task so avoid stalling main thread created ArrayBuffer object. Here example define handler message event case text frames: mysocket.onmessage = function == turnLampOn(); else == turnLampOff(); protocol here trivial server just sending messages. WebSocket closing handshake started, user agent queue task change readyState attribute's value CLOSING close() method was called, readyState attribute's value already be set CLOSING task runs.) WebSocket connection closed, possibly cleanly, user agent queue task run following substeps: Change readyState attribute's value CLOSED user agent was required fail WebSocket connection WebSocket connection closed prejudice, fire simple event named error WebSocket object. Create event uses CloseEvent interface, event type close, not bubble, not cancelable, default action, wasClean attribute initialized true connection closed cleanly false otherwise, code attribute initialized WebSocket connection close code, reason attribute initialized WebSocket connection close reason decoded UTF-8, error handling, dispatch event WebSocket object. User agents not convey failure information scripts way allow script distinguish following situations: server host name not be resolved. server packets not successfully be routed. server refused connection specified port. server failed correctly perform TLS handshake server certificate be verified). server did not complete opening handshake was not WebSocket server). WebSocket server sent correct opening handshake, specified options caused client drop connection server specified subprotocol client did not offer). WebSocket server abruptly closed connection successfully completing opening handshake. cases, WebSocket connection close code be required WebSocket Protocol specification. Allowing script distinguish cases allow script probe user's local network preparation attack. particular, means code not used user agent server erroneously uses close frame, course). task source tasks queued section WebSocket task source. Ping Pong frames WebSocket protocol specification Ping Pong frames be used keep-alive, heart-beats, network status probing, latency instrumentation, so forth. are not currently exposed API. User agents send ping unsolicited pong frames desired, example attempt maintain local network NAT mappings, detect failed connections, display latency metrics user. User agents not use pings unsolicited pongs aid server; assumed servers solicit pongs appropriate server's needs. Parsing WebSocket URLs steps parse WebSocket URL's components string url are steps return host, port, resource name, secure flag, fail. url string not absolute URL, then fail algorithm. Resolve url string, URL character encoding set UTF-8. matter resolved relative already know absolute URL point. url not have <scheme> component value, converted ASCII lowercase, then fail algorithm. url <fragment> component, then fail algorithm. <scheme> component url set secure false; otherwise, <scheme> component set secure true. Let host be value <host> component url, converted ASCII lowercase. url <port> component, then let port be component's value; otherwise, there explicit port. there explicit port, then: secure false, let port be otherwise let port be Let resource name be value <path> component be empty) url. resource name empty string, set single character U+002F SOLIDUS url <query> component, then single U+003F QUESTION MARK character resource name, followed value <query> component. Return host, port, resource name, secure.
