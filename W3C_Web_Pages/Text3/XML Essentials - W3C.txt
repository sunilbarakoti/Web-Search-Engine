Extensible Markup Language simple text-based format representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, much more. was derived older standard format called SGML order be more suitable Web use.

However, syntax rules XML are strict: XML tools not process files contain errors, instead give error messages so fix means almost XML documents be processed reliably computer software. main differences HTML are: elements be closed marked empty. Empty elements be closed normal, <happiness></happiness> use special short-form, <happiness instead. HTML, only need quote attribute value certain circumstances space, character not allowed name), rules are hard remember. XML, attribute values always be quoted: <happiness type="joy" HTML there built-in set element names attributes). XML, there are built-in names names starting xml have special meanings).

XML number advantages many other formats. particular scenario, be able come up better format, then have include costs converting processing format, training, XML-specific editing searching tool are now very widely available. advantages XML include: Redundancy XML markup very verbose. example, end tag be supplied, such </description> example. computer catch common errors such incorrect nesting. Self-describing readability XML text-based format) presence element attribute names XML means people looking XML document often get head start understanding format also people find mistakes!) Network effect XML Promise XML document be read processed XML tool whatsoever. course, XML tools want specific XML markup, XML format be read XML parser: say, XML document only be processed such-and-such tool. means new XML document increases value other XML document, XML tool, new XML tool increases value XML document hence other tool. Today, XML most widely-used format kind anywhere world.
