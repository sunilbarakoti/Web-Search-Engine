HTTP/1.0 TCP connectionfor URI retrieved cost packetsand round trip times then closes TCP connection. smallHTTP requests, TCP connections have poor performance due TCP slowstart well round trips required open close TCP connection. are least) reasons multiple simultaneous TCP connectionshave come widespread use Internet apparentinefficiencies: client using multiple TCP connections gains significant advantage perceived performance end-user, early retrieval metadata size) embedded objects page. client format page sooner suffering annoying reformatting page. Clients open multiple TCP connections parallel same server, however cause self congestion heavily congested links, packets generated TCP closes are not congestion controlled. additional TCP cause performance problems network, client multiple TCP connections simultaneously same server also receive bandwidth advantage network relative clients use single TCP connection. problem not solvable application level; only network enforce such keep low bandwidth/high latency links busy dialup lines), more TCP connection been necessary slow start cause line be partially idle. extension HTTP/1.0 form persistent TCP connectionsbut not work HTTP/1.0 proxies not take pipelining ofrequests account. Instead revised version persistent TCP connectionswas introduced HTTP/1.1 default mode operation. HTTP/1.1 persistent connections pipelining[11] reduce network traffic theamount TCP overhead caused opening closing TCP connections. However,the serialized behavior HTTP/1.1 pipelining not adequately supportsimultaneous rendering inlined objects part most Web pages today;nor provide suitable fairness protocol flows, allow forgraceful abortion HTTP transactions closing TCP connection(quite common HTTP operation). Persistent connections pipelining, however, do not fully address therendering fairness problems described solutionis possible using HTTP range requests; however, approach not, forexample, allow server send just metadata contained embedded objectbefore sending object solve TCP connection abortproblem. Current TCP implementations do not share congestion information multiplesimultaneous TCP connections peers, increases theoverhead opening new TCP connections. expect Transactional TCP[5] sharing congestion information TCP controlblocks improve TCP performance using lessRTTs better congestion behavior, making more suitable HTTPtransactions. solution problems actions; willnot entirely discourage opening multiple TCP connections same serverfrom client. Internet service providers enable Random Early Detection other active congestion control algorithms routers ensure bandwidth fairness clients network congested. RED also addresses queue length problems observed routers today. Development deployment multiplexing protocol use HTTP eventually other protocols), so multiple objects web server be fetched approximately simultaneously single TCP connection, so metadata objects be sent clients other metadata waiting rest first object requested. document such experimental multiplexing protocol. isdesigned multiplex TCP connection HTTP so HTTPitself not have change, allow coexistence multiple protocols(e.g. HTTP HTTP/NG), ease transitions future Web protocols,and communications client applets using private protocols serversover same TCP connection HTTP conversation. Ideas design come Simon Spero's SCP descriptionand experience WindowSystem's protocol design Goals believe SMUX following goals:: Unconfirmed service negotiation round trips server simple design high performance deadlock-free believe), credit based flow control scheme. allow multiple protocols be multiplexed same TCP connection allow connections be established direction callbacks session initiator). ability build full function socket interface protocol. low overhead alignment data stream, so easy use protocols marshal data binary form. SMUX Protocol Operation Deadlock Scenario Multiplexing multiple sessions single transport TCP connectionintroduces potential deadlock SMUX designed avoid. Here example potential deadlock: Presume session being handled independent thread memory available SMUX implementation limited example, thin client meter reader). purposes example, presume thin client bytes buffer available SMUX implementation, get more. sender data send, part session request message), bytes initial data. are other senders, so data transmitted. thread deal message blocked, make progress. SMUX buffer meg, pick favorite numbers), other session's data be blocked initial transmission SMUX read buffer data someplace buffer available, deadlock Many similar possibly harder explain) deadlocks are possible. example points deadlock possible: SMUX be able bufferdata independently consumers data. also havesome way throttle sessions consumer data not responsivein multiplexing layer example, prevent transmission morethan Kbytes data). Note deadlock independent ofthe size multiplexing fragment, strictly dependent availabilityof buffer space SMUX particular session. Deadlock Avoidance SMUX, receiver makes promise credit) transmitterthat certain amount buffer space available least willconsume bytes, not buffer e.g. real time audio protocol wherethe data disposed transmitter promises not send more datathan receiver promised more credit). thesepromises are met, then SMUX not deadlock. SMUX implementation MUST maintain adhere credit system itcan deadlock. Implementations systems large amounts memory(e.g. VM systems) be quite different ones thin clients limited,non-virtual memory. reasonable VM system hand creditsfreely virtual socket buffering found TCP implementations);but implementation be careful test credit mechanisms sothat inter operate limited memory systems. Credit controlmessages MAY be sent sessions are not active. Sessions have initial credit size 16KB session; there SMUX control message set initial creditto something larger default. Operation Implementation Considerations transmitter MUST NOT transmit more data fragment availablecredit session deadlock). SMUX implementation MUST fragment streams transmitting intofragments. max_fragment_size, variable ismaintained transport TCP connection basis, determinesthe largest possible fragment sender ever send receiver. maximum latency introduced SMUX layer andbeyond inherent TCP latencies buffering sender receiverand delay-bandwidth product amount data be flight atany given instant). client low bandwidth link, limitedmemory buffering decide set max_fragment_size down tocontrol latency buffer space required. max_fragment_sizeis set transmitter left determine fragment size andMAY take account application protocol knowledge SMUX implementationfor HTTP send fragments metadata embedded objects, phase progressive image format, only Animplementation honor max_fragment_size transmitsdata, been set receiver. SMUX implementation not have explicit knowledge experienceof good fragment sizes use guidelines starting point: path_MTU TCP connection, size TCP IP headers IPV6 have longer headers!) bytes XMUX header, information available MSS TCP connection, path_MTU not available case, probably want subtract bytes make sure SMUX header be added forcing TCP segment. result fragmentation roughly similar TCP segmentation overmultiple TCP connections. implementation round robin sessions data send insome fashion avoid starving sessions, allowing single thread tomonopolize TCP connection. Exact details such behavior leftto implementation. achieve highest bandwidth lowest overheadSMUX behavior, credits be handed reasonably large chunks. TCPimplementations typically send ack message other packet, andit very hard arrange piggyback acks data segments inimplementations. Therefore, SMUX have reasonably low overheadcredits be handed significant multiple more timeslarger) bytes represented packets ethernet. outstanding credit balance active sessions also have belarger bandwidth/delay product TCP connection SMUX isnot become limit TCP transport performance. arguments indicate outstanding credits many implementationsshould be bytes more. Implementations piggyback creditmessages data packets possible, avoid unneeded packets thewire. careful implementation ends TCP connectionare regularly sending payload be able avoid sending extrapackets network. necessary, add future version fragmentation control messagesto do bandwidth allocation, now, are not bothering.

Remaining Issues Discussion MUX be used??? are appropriate strategies determining simple multiplexing protocol be used? Name server hack? UPGRADE HTTP? Remember previous UPGRADE use MUX worked? Comparison SCP Note TIP Internet Protocol) definesa version SCP called TMP Goals: Unconfirmed service negotiation. SCP data be sent session establishment; recipient not confirm successful mux connection establishment, reject unsuccessful attempts. design protocol, latency required confirmed operation. simple design performance critical are issues make SCP inadequate use: SCP deadlock, unlimited amounts memory available. provision multiplexing multiple protocols same transport TCP connection, essential graceful transition dependency currently incomplete NG design, allow other uses use same multiplexed connection applet communication serverlets). SCP's byte overhead not reasonable most time. SMUX uses bytes default case. design permits byte header care preserve bit alignment cost bytes. practice, there few data formats architectures actually require more bit alignment. form flow control, infinite buffering clients be required. Alignment preserved data stream. compact, high speed code implementations binary protocols, extra data copies, such protocols be significant overhead. SCP SYN Version second message, costs round trip. So far, SMUX similar SCP. are important differences: deadlock-free believe), credit based flow control scheme. allow multiple protocols be multiplexed same TCP connection available SCP). lower overhead SCP, preserving data alignment important binary protocol marshaling code) ability build full function socket interface protocol. SMUX avoids SYN round trip SCP V2 session ID's being allocated independent address spaces. also avoids many state transitions SCP, simplifying protocol greatly. Other comment SCP: SCP sessions, highly excessive, reserves1024 future use. Closed Issues Discussion Mail comments previous versions specification,and not make sense context current version. Flow control: priority credit schemes Henrik have convinced there are fundamental differences betweena priority scheme credit scheme draft. interactquite differently TCP, priority schemes have way limit thetotal amount data being transmitted, priority schemes are bettermatched Web decided, least now, todefer priority schemes higher level protocols. Stacking Protocols Transports ILU style protocol stacks are GOOD THING. have been too manyworries birthday problem people be comfortable BillJanssen's hashing schemes Nielsen andRobertThau's mail topic). tried putting directlyin MUX previous version, experience shows didn't reallyhelp implementer particular, Bill Janssen implementing ILU). version just name protocol, left othersto implement stacking ILU). believe name protocol necessary, SMUX ever be usedwith firewalls. Application level firewall relays need protocolinformation sanity check protocol being relayed. Application levelrelays are considered much more secure just punching holes firewallfor particular protocol families, small organizations often findsufficient, relay sanity check protocol stream enablebetter policy decisions example, forbid certain datatypes HTTPto transit firewall). Large organizations large targets typicallyonly run application level proxies. Byte Usage Wasting bytes general, particular TCP connection establishment,for multiplexing transport be avoided. are several reasons forthis: initial segment too long, network round trip be lost TCP slow start, so bytes beginning conversation MAY BE much more precious bytes later conversation, once slow start overhead been paid. first segment too long, fall cliff. Directly user perceived response; cleverness later packing batching request get time back; directly perceived latency user talks server first time. So there more usual tension generality performance.Performance analysis Human perception milliseconds; much more userperceives delay. K baud, byte uncompressed costs milliseconds modem latencies). airplane telephone today, geta munificent baud, 3X slower. Cellular modems transmittingdata understand give 20Kbaud, deployed. So basic multiplexing byte overhead costs milliseconds commonmodems. means basic overhead small human perception, mostlow speed situations, good position be cMux onnection open, protocol send bytes setupmessage, then open session, requiring least bytes more. 12bytes == milliseconds Not bit aligned, bytes costs oforder milliseconds. Ugh... Maybe setup message good idea; otheruses security) be dealt control message. Multiple protocols SMUX want SMUX multiple protocols simultaneously same transportTCP connection, so need know protocol use session,so demultipexor hand data right person. SUNRPC andDCERCP simultaneously). are obvious ways see do Send control message session first used, indicating protocol. Disadvantage: costs probably bytes do so SMUX overhead, byte message), potential bit alignment. b) syn set indicating new session, then steal mux_length field indicate protocol use session. bytes SMUX header used just establish session.) Opinions? Mine b) better Answer: b) adopted strategy. Priority... given stream, priority affect session handled whenmultiplexing data; sending priority block unneeded, wouldwaste bytes. case priority be useful: anintermediate proxy relaying sessions maybe remultiplexing so, be sent only sessions are established changed. Changescan be handled control message. Opinions? priority field be hacked length field protocol fieldusing b) So question important send priority SMUXprotocol? priority control, needed, be control message? message). Answer: Not protocol. Opens Pandora's box remultiplexors, whichcould have denial service attacks. Setup message setup message needed? don't think initial bytes areprecious performance discussion trivial use.If move byte order flag SMUX header, use control messagesif other information needs be sent, dispense layeris simpler. current position, someone objects withreasons, nuke version document. Answer: Not needed. Nuked. Byte order flags higher layer protocols using host dependent byte order be performance win sending larger objects such arrays data), overheadat layer much, not be worth bothering Worst case(naive code) be memory shift overhead/payload. Smartcode load appropriate shifts etc. Opinions? still leaning swapping bytes here, there are otherexamples byte load shift slow Alpha, not muchof issue other systems). Answer: Not sufficient performance gain SMUX level be worth doing.Defined LE byte order SMUX headers. Error handling are several error conditions, probably best reported control messagesfrom server: such protocol. sort serial number be reported, suppose; serial number be implicit X bad message. combinations flag bits are not legal. Priority others? twists worry Answer: Only error occur such protocol, given priorityin base protocol. May still be unresolved issues here Tree" message bits turned Length Field reason believe bit length field single payload isinadequate? don't think so, live Alpha. Answer: bit extended length field single fragment sufficient. Compression Does there need be bit saying payload compressed avoid explosionof protocol types? Answer: introduction control message allow specification transportstacks Stacks think be able multiplex TCP, UDP, IP protocol.Internet protocol numbers are bit fields. So need bits TCP, bit distinguish TCP UDP, bitmore use IP protocol numbers address space allocateprivately. bit length field allow reuse.* bit length field bit session field control bits longlength bit last bit used define control messages, reuse syn, fin,rst, push bits control_code define control message. Thereare undefined control codes, reservation twosessions further use there needs be further extensions. specabove Alignment Back alignment. demand byte alignment, requests donot end up naturally aligned, waste bytes. bytes are wasted average.At overhead protocols do not pad up meanbe bytes rather bytes ms even distributionsof length). Note DOES NOT effect initial request latency get first URL), therefore less critical elsewhere. have related worry; sometimes be painful get padding bytesat end buffer; heard people losing having data rightup end page, so implementations are living slightly dangerously presume send padding bytes sending or3 bytes buffer independent write OS forpadding bytes). Alternatively, buffer alignment requirement be satisfied byimplementations remembering many pad bytes have be sent, adjustingthe beginning address subsequent write many bytes thebuffer SMUX header been put. Am being unnecessarily paranoid? Opinion: believe alignment fragments general GOOD THING, andwill simplify SMUX transport protocols higher levels make presumption implementations. So believe overheadis worth cost; want do better bytes, then startbuilding application specific compression scheme. not, please makeyour case. Control bits Are bits defined Simon's flags field need? Are thereany others? Answer: More bits need. Current protocol use many.I've ended back original bits specified, rather smaller setsuggested Bill Janssen. full emulation detailsof socket interface, not otherwise be possible. See detailsaround TCP socket handling, discussed books Illustrated,"by W. Richard Stevens. Am wet? Opinion: believe do Control Messages Question: do want/need short control message? Right now, forextensibility are control messages sent reserved yet unspecified) control session. minimum bytes wire. couldsteal last available bit, allow byte short control message,that have bits payload. Opinion: Flow control needs protocol/transport stacks need Documentabove now control messages.
