Data cubes section non-normative. Data Sets section non-normative. DataSet collection statistical data defined structure. data data set be roughly described belonging following kinds: Observations actual data, measured values. statistical table, observations be values table cells. Organizational structure locate observation hypercube, least know value dimension observation located, so values be specified observation. Datasets have additional organizational structure form slices described section Structural metadata Having located observation, need certain metadata order be able interpret unit measurement? normal value series break? value measured estimated? metadata are provided attributes be attached individual observations, higher levels. Reference metadata metadata dataset whole, such categorization dataset, publisher, SPARQL endpoint be accessed. External metadata described section cube model dimensions, attributes, measures section non-normative. statistical data set collection observations madeat points logical space. collection be characterized bya set dimensions define observation time,area, gender) metadata describing beenmeasured economic activity, population), was measured theobservations are expressed units, multipliers, status). canthink statistical data set multi-dimensionalspace, hyper-cube, indexed dimensions. space iscommonly referred toas cube short; name be takenliterally, not meant imply thatthere are exactly dimensions be more fewer) northatall dimensions are somehow similar size. cube organized according set dimensions,attributes measures. collectively call components. dimension components serve identifythe observations. set values dimensioncomponentsis sufficient identify single observation. Examples dimensionsinclude thetime observation geographic region observation covers. measure components represent phenomenon beingobserved. attribute components allow qualify andinterpret observed value(s). enable specification units ofmeasure, scaling factors metadata such statusof observation estimated, provisional). Introducing Slices section non-normative. frequently useful group subsets observations adataset. particular fix small subset) thedimensions be able refer observations thosedimension values single entity. call such selection slicethrough cube. example, given data set regional performanceindicators then group together observations given indicatorand given region. such group be slice representing time series observed values. data publisher identify slices data variouspurposes. be useful grouping metadata be attached, example note achange measurement process whichaffects particular time region. Slices also enable publisher toidentify label particular subsets data be presented enable consuming application more easily construct appropriate graph chart presentation. statistical applications common work withslices single dimension left unspecified. particular,to refer such slices single free dimension time TimeSeries refer slices non-time dimensions Sections.Within Data Cube vocabulary allow arbitrary dimensionalityslices do not give different names particular types slice. Such sub-classes slice be added extension vocabularies. example section non-normative. order illustrate use data cube vocabulary willuse small demonstrationdata set extracted fromStatsWales reportnumber life expectancy broken down region(unitary authority), age time. extract use Male Female Male Female Male Female Newport Cardiff Monmouthshire MerthyrTydfil see there are dimensions time period averages year timespans), region sex. observation life expectancy population measure) need attribute define units measured values. example slicing data be define slices time sex arefixed slice. Such slices then show variation life expectancy different regions, i.e. corresponding columns tabular layout. complete encoding data Data Cube, including such slice structure, shown Appendix C. Creating data structure definitions qb:DataStructureDefinition structure moredatasets. particular, dimensions, attributes measures used dataset qualifying information such ordering dimensions attributes are required optional. well-formed data sets much information implicit RDF component properties found observations. However, explicit declaration structure several benefits: verification data set matches expected structure, particular detection incoherent sets obtained combining differently structured source data; consumer easily determine dimensions are available query presentational order, turn data consumption, example UI construction; supports transmission structure information associated SDMX data flows common, publishing statistical data, have regular series publications whichall follow same structure. notion Data Structure Definition definethat structure once then reuse publication series. Consumers then be confident structure data not changed. Dimensions, attributes measures Data Cube vocabulary dimensions, attributes measures RDF properties. instance abstract qb:ComponentProperty class, turn sub-classes qb:DimensionProperty, qb:AttributeProperty qb:MeasureProperty. component property several pieces information: concept being represented time geographic area), nature component attribute measure) represented type component property, type code list used represent value. same concept be manifested different components. example, concept currency be used dimension data set dealing exchange rates) attribute describing currency observed trade took place). concept time typically used only dimension be encoded data value xsd:dateTime) symbolic value URI drawn reference time URI set developed data.gov.uk). statistical agencies common have standard thesaurus statistical concepts underpin components used multiple different data sets. support reuse general statistical concepts data cube vocabulary qb:concept property links qb:ComponentProperty concept use SKOS vocabulary represent such concepts. very natural cases concepts are already maintained controlled term list thesaurus. developing data structure definition informal data set there not be appropriate concept already. cases, concept likely be reused other guises recommended publish skos:Concept specific qb:ComponentProperty. However, such reuse not expected then not required do so qb:concept link optional simple instance appropriate subclass qb:ComponentProperty sufficient. representation possible values component described using rdfs:range property component usual RDF manner. Thus, example, values time dimension be represented using literals type xsd:dateTime URIs drawn time reference service. statistical data sets common values be encoded using hierarchical) code list be useful be able easily identify overall code list more structured form. cater component also be optionally annotated qb:codeList indicate set skos:Concepts be used codes. qb:codeList value be skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection qb:HierarchicalCodeList. such case rdfs:range component be left simply skos:Concept useful design pattern also define rdfs:Class members are skos:Concepts particular scheme. way rdfs:range be made more specific generic RDF tools perform appropriate range checking. Note SDMX extension vocabulary there be further item information encode components role play structure definition. particular, sometimes convenient consumers be able easily identify time dimension, component primary measure so forth. turns such roles are intrinsic concepts so information be encoded providing subclasses skos:Concept role. particular choice roles here specific SDMX standard so not included core Data Cube vocabulary. illustrating components needed running example, there more piece machinery introduce, reusable set concepts components based SDMX. Content oriented guidelines section non-normative. SDMX standard set content oriented guidelines define set common statistical concepts associated code lists are intended be reusable data sets. community group developed RDF encodings guidelines. comprise: Prefix Namespace Description sdmx-concept http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/concept# SKOS Concepts COG defined concept sdmx-code http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code# SKOS Concepts ConceptSchemes COG defined code list sdmx-dimension http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/dimension# component properties corresponding COG concept be used dimension sdmx-attribute http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/attribute# component properties corresponding COG concept be used attribute sdmx-measure http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/measure# component properties corresponding COG concept be used measure community resources are provided convenience do not form part Data Cube specification. However, are used number existing Data Cube publications so reference worked examples. Example dimensions measure section non-normative. Turning example data set then see there are dimensions represent time period, region authority) sex. single measure topic data set expectancy) value years. Hence, need following components. Time. suitable predefined concept SMDX-COG REF_PERIOD, so reuse corresponding component property sdmx-dimension:refPeriod. However, represent time period be convenient use data.gov.uk reference time service declare data structure definition. Example eg:refPeriod rdf:Property, qb:DimensionProperty; rdfs:label period"@en; rdfs:subPropertyOf sdmx-dimension:refPeriod; rdfs:range interval:Interval; qb:concept sdmx-concept:refPeriod Region. Again there suitable COG concept associated component use again customize range component. case use Ordnance Survey Administrative Geography Ontology Example eg:refArea rdf:Property, qb:DimensionProperty; rdfs:label area"@en; rdfs:subPropertyOf sdmx-dimension:refArea; rdfs:range admingeo:UnitaryAuthority; qb:concept sdmx-concept:refArea Sex. case use corresponding COG component sdmx-dimension:sex directly, default code list terms need. Measure. property give value observation. use default smdx-measure:obsValue topic being observed using metadata). However, aid readability processing RDF data sets use specific measure corresponding phenomenon being observed. Example eg:lifeExpectancy rdf:Property, qb:MeasureProperty; rdfs:label expectancy"@en; rdfs:subPropertyOf sdmx-measure:obsValue; rdfs:range xsd:decimal Unit measure attribute. primary measure own plain decimal value. correctly interpret value need define units measured case). defined using attributes qualify interpretation observed value. Specifically example use predefined sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure turn COG concept UNIT_MEASURE. express value attribute typically use common thesaurus units measure. sake simple example use DBpedia resource http://dbpedia.org/resource/Year topic Wikipedia page covers minimal components needed define structure data set. ComponentSpecifications DataStructureDefinitions combine components specification structure dataset need declare qb:DataStructureDefinition resource turn reference set qb:ComponentSpecification resources. qb:DataStructureDefinition be reusable other data sets same structure. simplest case qb:ComponentSpecification simply references corresponding qb:ComponentProperty using sub properties qb:dimension, qb:measure qb:attribute). However, also possible qualify component specification several ways. Attributes be declared optional required. attribute required be present observation then specification set qb:componentRequired. absence such declaration attribute assumed be optional. qb:componentRequired declaration only be applied component specifications attributes measures dimensions are always required. components be ordered giving integer value qb:order. order semantics be useful aid consuming agents generating appropriate user interfaces. also be useful publication chain enable synthesis appropriate URIs observations. default values components be attached individual observation, called normalized representation. such observations stand alone, so SPARQL query retrieve observation immediately locate attributes enable observation be interpreted. However, also permissible attach attributes overall data set, intervening slice specific Measure case multiple measures). redundancy encoding instance data. declare such abbreviated structure, qb:componentAttachment property specification reference class corresponding attachment level qb:DataSet attributes be attached overall data set). classes be used such attachment levels are subclasses qb:Attachable. case running example dimensions be usefully ordered. only attribute, unit measure, required. interest illustrating vocabulary use declare attribute be attached level data set, however normalized representations are general easier query combine. So structure example data set other similar datasets) be declared Example eg:dsd-le qb:DataStructureDefinition; dimensions qb:component qb:dimension eg:refArea; qb:order qb:component qb:dimension eg:refPeriod; qb:order qb:component qb:dimension sdmx-dimension:sex; qb:order measure(s) qb:component qb:measure eg:lifeExpectancy]; attributes qb:component qb:attribute sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure; qb:componentRequired qb:componentAttachment qb:DataSet; Note have given data structure definition URI be reused different datasets same structure. Similarly component properties be reused different DSDs. However, component specifications are only useful scope particular DSD so have chosen represent using blank nodes. Handling multiple measures example data set relatively simple having single observable case expectancy") being measured. other data sets there be multiple measures. measures be similar nature data set local government performance provide multiple different performance indicators region) quite different data set trades provide quantity, value, weight trade). are approaches representing multiple measures supported Data Cube vocabulary. first approach observation records single observed value measure.We introduce additional dimension value measure being conveyed observation. measure dimension approach supported SDMX information model. second approach single observation provide values multiple different measures.This particularly appropriate cases values singleobservational event such multi-spectral sensor measurement. multi-measureapproach commonly used applications such Business Intelligence OLAP. Data Cube vocabulary permits representation approach be used be mixed same data set. representation approaches require point space dimensions there observation, value be given measure. case multi-measure observations measure be present observation. cubes use measure dimension there are sets observations populated point cube sets there be observation giving measure. Multi-measure observations approach multiple observed values be attached individual observation. suited representation things sensor data OLAP cubes. use representation simply declare multiple qb:MeasureProperty components data structure definition attach instance property observations data set. example, have set shipment data containing unit count total weight shipment then have data structure definition such Example eg:dsd1 qb:DataStructureDefinition; rdfs:comment time measures approach)"@en; qb:component qb:dimension sdmx-dimension:refTime; qb:measure eg-measure:quantity; qb:measure eg-measure:weight; correspond individual observations such Example eg:dataset1 qb:DataSet; qb:structure eg:dsd1 eg:obs1a qb:Observation; qb:dataSet eg:dataset1; sdmx-dimension:refTime eg-measure:weight eg-measure:quantity Note limitation multi-measure approach not possible attach attribute single observed value. attribute attached observation instance apply whole observation indicate made observation). Attributes also be attached directly qb:MeasureProperty indicate unit measure measure) attachment whole data set data set using measure property) vary different observations. applications limitation problem then use measure dimension approach. Measure dimension approach observations having single measured value data set carry multiple measures adding extra dimension, measure dimension. value measure dimension particular measure being conveyed observation. representation approach used SDMX extension vocabulary introduce sub-class qb:DataStructureDefinition such single-measure restriction. use representation declare additional dimension data structure definition play role measure dimension. use Data Cube vocabulary provide single distinguished component purpose qb:measureType. extension vocabulary generalize provision roles identify concepts act measure types, enabling other measure dimensions be declared. special case using qb:measureType measure dimension, set allowed measures assumed be measures declared DSD. need define separate code list enumerated class duplicate information. Thus, qb:measureType â€œmagicâ€? dimension property implicit code list. notion implicit code list qb:measureType small divergence SDMX usage. data structure definition example, using representation approach, then be: Example eg:dsd2 qb:DataStructureDefinition; rdfs:comment time dimension approach)"@en; qb:component qb:dimension sdmx-dimension:refTime; qb:measure eg-measure:quantity; qb:measure eg-measure:weight; qb:dimension qb:measureType; correspond individual observations such Example eg:dataset2 qb:DataSet; qb:structure eg:dsd2 eg:obs2a qb:Observation; qb:dataSet eg:dataset2; sdmx-dimension:refTime qb:measureType eg-measure:weight eg-measure:weight eg:obs2b qb:Observation; qb:dataSet eg:dataset2; sdmx-dimension:refTime qb:measureType eg-measure:quantity eg-measure:quantity Note duplication having measure property show up property measured value, value measure dimension. accept duplication necessary ensure uniform cube/dimension mechanism uniform way declaring using measure properties kinds datasets. familiar SDMX also note RDF representation there need separate measure" individual measures, individual measures are used directly. Extension vocabularies address round-tripping SDMX primary measure use separate annotation data structure definition. Expressing data sets Data sets observations resource representing entire data set created typed qb:DataSet linked corresponding data structure definition qb:structure property. Pitfall: Note capitalization qb:DataSet, capitalization other vocabularies, such asvoid:Dataset dcat:Dataset. unusual capitalization chosen compatibilitywith SDMX standard. same related property qb:dataSet. observation represented instance type qb:Observation. basic case then values attributes, dimensions measurements are attached directly observation components are RDF properties). observation linked containing data set using qb:dataSet property. Thus running example expect have: Example eg:dataset-le1 qb:DataSet; rdfs:label expectancy"@en; rdfs:comment expectancy Welsh Unitary authorities extracted Stats Wales"@en; qb:structure eg:dsd-le eg:o1 qb:Observation; qb:dataSet eg:dataset-le1 eg:refArea ex-geo:newport_00pr eg:refPeriod <http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/2004-01-01T00:00:00/P3Y> sdmx-dimension:sex sdmx-code:sex-M sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Year> eg:lifeExpectancy qb:Observation; qb:dataSet eg:dataset-le1 eg:refArea ex-geo:cardiff_00pt eg:refPeriod <http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/2004-01-01T00:00:00/P3Y> sdmx-dimension:sex sdmx-code:sex-M sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Year> eg:lifeExpectancy qb:Observation; qb:dataSet eg:dataset-le1 eg:refArea ex-geo:monmouthshire_00pp eg:refPeriod <http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/2004-01-01T00:00:00/P3Y> sdmx-dimension:sex sdmx-code:sex-M sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Year> eg:lifeExpectancy normalized structure makes easy query combine data sets there redundancy here. example, unit measure life expectancy uniform whole data set not change observations. cater situations Data Cube vocabulary components be attached high level nested structure.

Slices groups observations Slices allow group subsets observations together. not intended represent arbitrary selections observations uniform slices cube more dimension values are fixed. Slices be used number reasons: guide consuming applications present data organize data set time series); provide identity slice enable be annotated externally referenced; reduce verbosity data set only stating fixed dimensional value once. illustrate use slices let group sample data set geographic series. enable refer e.g. life expectancy observations guide applications present comparative chart regions. first define structure slices want associating key" data structure definition. done creating qb:SliceKey list component properties be dimensions) be fixed slice. key attached DSD using qb:sliceKey. example: Example eg:sliceByRegion qb:SliceKey; rdfs:label region"@en; rdfs:comment grouping regions together, fixing sex time values"@en; qb:componentProperty eg:refPeriod, sdmx-dimension:sex eg:dsd-le-slice1 qb:DataStructureDefinition; qb:component qb:dimension eg:refArea; qb:order qb:dimension eg:refPeriod; qb:order qb:dimension sdmx-dimension:sex; qb:order qb:measure eg:lifeExpectancy]; sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure; qb:componentAttachment qb:DataSet; qb:sliceKey eg:sliceByRegion instance data then slices are represented instances qb:Slice link observations slice qb:observation key means qb:sliceStructure.

SKOS specification generation custom datatype foreach use skos:notation here notation not intended usewithin RDF encodings, merely documents notation used other representations do not use such datatype). convenient good practice developing code list also create Class denote codes codelist, irrespective hierarchical structure. range anqb:ComponentProperty be defined using rdfs:rangewhich then permits standard RDF closed-world checkers validate use list requiring custom SDMX-RDF-aware tooling. do theabove example using common convention class name concept scheme leading upper case. code list then be associated coded property, such dimension: Example eg:sex qb:DimensionProperty, qb:CodedProperty; qb:codeList sdmx-code:sex rdfs:range sdmx-code:Sex Explicitly declaring code list using qb:codeList not mandatory be helpful cases concept scheme been defined. Hierarchical code lists cases code lists have hierarchical structure. particular, used SDMX data cube aggregations data values aggregating measure geographic regions).Hierarchical code lists be represented using skos:narrower relationship, sub-property link skos:hasTopConceptcodes down tree lattice child codes. publishing tool chains corresponding transitive closure skos:narrowerTransitive be automatically inferred. use skos:narrower makes possible declare new concept schemes extend existing scheme adding additional aggregation layers top.All items are linked scheme skos:inScheme. Non-SKOS hierarchies sometimes convenient be able specify hierarchical arrangement concepts other use SKOS relation skos:narrower. are several situations useful, example: cases publishers wish be able reuse existing reference data theircode lists. particularly geographic admin-geographic hierarchyis already maintained separate authority uses non-SKOS containment part-of relationships. such maintained reference data be reused there be multiple hierarchies relatethe same codes. particular set geographic entities participate geographic-containment hierarchyand administrative hierarchy do not precisely align. Data Cube vocabulary supports situation qb:HierarchicalCodeList class.An instance qb:HierarchicalCodeList set root concepts hierarchy parent-to-child relationship whichlinks term hierarchy immediate sub-terms. Thus qb:HierarchicalCodeListis similar skos:ConceptScheme qb:hierarchyRoot plays samerole skos:hasTopConcept, value qb:parentChildProperty playsthe same role skos:narrower. case code list already available SKOS concept scheme collection, reasonable made so, then be used directly. qb:HierarchicalCodeList provided cases terms are not available SKOS are available other RDF representation suitable reuse. example, Ordnance Survey Great Britain geographic hierarchy eleven roots Regions such Wales, Scotland, South West) uses spatial relations ontology define containment hierarchy. be represented qb:HierarchicalCodeList using following.

Aggregation use SKOS, non-SKOS, hierarchies makes possible publish aggregatedstatistics non-leaf concepts hierarchy. Data Cube vocabulary imposesno constraints such aggregation done. Indeed statistical applications statistical corrections make aggregated values be non-trivial dependent data precise analysis methodology. Similarly other applications such OLAP number different aggregation operators are commonly used. Vocabulary terms represent aggregation operations employed given dataset, dataset be derived are not supported version Data Cube specification. Thisarea be addressed future extensions Data Cube. DataSet metadata DataSets be marked up metadata support discovery, presentation processing. Dublin Core Terms be used representing key metadata annotations commonly needed DataSets. RDFS terms display label descriptive comment be given well compatibility earlier versions Data Cube common RDF practice. recommend core set metadata terms dct:title rdfs:label be same dct:title dct:description rdfs:comment be same dct:description dct:issued dct:modified dct:subject dct:publisher dct:license Other documents, notably provide additional recommendations metadata terms data sets be used describing Data Cube DataSets. Categorizing data set Publishers statistics often categorize data sets different statistical domains, such Education, Labour, Transportation.We encourage use dct:subject record such classification ofa whole data set.The classification terms include coarse grained classifications, suchas List Subject-matter Domains SDMX Content-oriented Guidelines, fine grained classifications support discovery data sets. classification schemes are typically represented using SKOS vocabulary. convenience SMDX Subject-matter Domains have been encoded SKOS concept schemeat http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/subject#. Thus sample dataset be marked up Example eg:dataset1 qb:DataSet; rdfs:label expectancy"@en; dct:title expectancy"@en; rdfs:comment expectancy Welsh Unitary authorities extracted Stats Wales"@en; dct:description expectancy Welsh Unitary authorities extracted Stats Wales"@en; dct:issued dct:subject sdmx-subject:3.2 regional small area statistics sdmx-subject:1.4 Health eg:Wales; Wales eg:Wales skos:Concept drawn appropriate controlledvocabulary places. Describing publishers organization dataset be recorded part dataset metadata.Again recommend use Dublin Core term dct:publisher this.The organization be represented instance foaf:Agent, orsome more specific subclass such org:Organization Example eg:dataset1 qb:DataSet; dct:publisher <http://example.com/meta#organization> <http://example.com/meta#organization> org:Organization, foaf:Agent; rdfs:label org" Extension vocabularies provide additional metadata properties impose constraints metadata be provided. Abbreviated normalized data cubes normal form then qb:Observations whichmake up Data Cube have property values requireddimensions, attributes measures declared associated datastructure definition. form Data Cube istermed normalized. convenient format forquerying data makes possible write uniform queries whichextract sets observations, including multiplecubes. However, verbosity fully normalized representationincurs overheads transmission storage Data Cubes maybe problematic settings.
