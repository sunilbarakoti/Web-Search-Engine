Broadly speaking, inference Semantic Web be characterized bydiscovering new relationships. Semantic Web, data modeled relationships resources. means thatautomatic procedures generate new relationships based dataand based additional information form vocabulary, e.g., rules. new relationships are explicitly added data, are returned query time, implementationissue. Semantic Web, source such extra information be definedvia vocabularies rule sets. approaches draw knowledge representation techniques. Ingeneral, ontologies concentrate classification methods, putting anemphasis defining individualresources be associated such classes, characterizing therelationships classes instances.
