XLink framework creating basic unidirectional links more complex linking structures. XML documents Assert linking relationships more resources Associate metadata link Express links reside location separate linked resources important application XLink hypermedia systems have hyperlinks. simple case hyperlink HTML element, characteristics: hyperlink uses IRIs locator technology. hyperlink expressed ends. hyperlink other end server have great freedom finding dynamically creating destination). Users initiate traversal only end hyperlink expressed other end. hyperlink's effect windows, frames, go-back lists, style sheets use, so determined user agents, not hyperlink example, traversal links normally current view, perhaps user option open new window. set characteristics powerful, model limits range possible hyperlink functionality. model defined specification shares HTML use IRI technology, HTML offering features, previously available only dedicated hypermedia systems, make hyperlinking more scalable flexible. providing linking data structures, XLink minimal link behavior model; higher-level applications layered XLink willoften specify alternate more sophisticated rendering processing treatments. Integrated treatment specialized links used other technical domains, such foreign keys relational databases reference values programming languages, scope specification. languages, such wish identify hypertext links document, suggest local element XLink traversal possible, application specified actuate="onRequest", be treated hyperlink source anchor. Origin Goals design XLink been informed knowledge established hypermedia systems standards. following standards have been especially influential: HTML several element types represent links. HyTime inline inbound third-party link structures semantic features, including traversal control presentation objects. Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines structures creating links, aggregate objects, link collections. Many other linking systems have also informed design XLink, especially See XLink Requirements Document thorough explanation requirements design XLink. XLink Concepts section terms concepts are essential understanding XLink, discussing syntax used create XLink constructs. few additional terms are introduced later parts specification.

XLink Markup Design section design XLink's markup vocabulary. Link markup needs be recognized reliably XLink applications order be traversed handled properly. XLink uses mechanism described Namespaces XML Recommendation Names] accomplish recognition constructs XLink vocabulary. XLink namespace defined specification following URI: http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink dictated Names], use XLink elements attributes declaration XLink namespace. example, following declaration make prefix xlink available myElement element represent XLink namespace: <myElement xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"> Note: Most code examples specification do not show XLink namespace declaration. xlink prefix used stand declaration XLink namespace elements scope so-marked attribute same element bears attribute ancestor element), not XLink namespace declaration present example. XLink's namespace global attributes use elements are arbitrary namespace. global attributes are type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, other attributes, elements, XLink namespace are reserved. Document creators use XLink global attributes make elements own namespace,or even namespace do not control, recognizable XLink elements. type attribute XLink element type extended, locator, arc, resource, title); element type XLink-imposed constraints such element follow behavior XLink applications encountering element. Following example crossReference element non-XLink namespace XLink global attributes: <my:crossReference xmlns:my="http://example.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="students.xml" xlink:role="http://www.example.com/linkprops/studentlist" xlink:title="Student List" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Current List Students</my:crossReference> Using global attributes always use namespace prefixes individual attributes. Linking Language Version XLink elements are identified presence xlink:type attribute. XLink XLink elements are identified presence xlink:type attribute xlink:href attribute: element xlink:type attribute, then attribute have following values: â€œsimpleâ€?, â€œextendedâ€?, â€œlocatorâ€?, â€œarcâ€?, â€œresourceâ€?, â€œtitleâ€? element adhere conformance constraints imposed XLink element type. element xlink:href attribute not have xlink:type attribute, then treated exactly had xlink:type attribute value â€œsimpleâ€?. XLink Attribute Usage Patterns XLink attributes are considered global virtue use namespace mechanism, allowed combinations XLink element type depend greatly value special type attribute XLink Element Type Attribute more information) element appear. conformance constraint notes specification detail allowed usage patterns. Following summary element types(columns) global attributes are allowed, indication value required optional simple extended locator arc resource title type O* R R R R R href O* R role O O O O arcrole O O title O O O O O show O O actuate O O label O O O O least type href be specified. also B Sample DTD, C Sample XML Schema, D Sample RELAX NG Grammar examples non-normative schemas illustrate allowed patterns attributes.) specification uses convention element" refer elements adhere named set constraints associated XLink element type, matter name element actually example, element" refer following elements: <locator xlink:type="locator" xlink:type="locator" xlink:type="locator" XLink Element Type Relationships Various XLink element types have special meanings dictated specification appear direct children other XLink element types. Following summary child element types play significant role particular parent element types. combinations are not conformant.) Parent type Significant child types simple none extended locator, arc, resource, title locator title arc title resource none title none Attribute Value Defaulting Using XLink potentially using large number attributes supplying important link information. cases values desired XLink attributes are unchanging individual instances documents certain type, attribute value defaults not) be added DTD schema so attributes do not have appear physically element start-tags. example, attribute defaults were provided thexmlns:xlink, xmlns:my, type, show, actuate attributes example introduction XLink Markup Design, example look <my:crossReference xlink:href="students.xml" xlink:role="http://www.example.com/linkprops/studentlist" xlink:title="Student List">Current List Students</my:crossReference> Information sets have been created control DTD have attribute values filled Note, however, parsers are not required process external subset. Applications, such web browsers, do not process external subset not be aware default values identified therein. Note also using attribute value default technique specify XLink namespace declaration equivalent NG], Schema Part Structures], other modern schema languages. be used DTD-informed parsing performed, interoperability risk be used care. Integrating XLink Usage Other Markup specification only attributes attribute values XLink namespace. restriction using non-XLink attributes XLink attributes. addition, most XLink attributes are optional choice simple extended link up markup designer document creator, so DTD other schema uses XLink features need not use declare entire set XLink's attributes. Finally, specification minimum constraints XLink markup,schemas use XLink are free tighten constraints. use XLink not absolve valid document conforming constraints expressed governing schema. Following example crossReference element XLink non-XLink attributes: <my:crossReference xmlns:my="http://example.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="students.xml">Current List Students</my:crossReference> Using XLink Legacy Markup XLink's global attributes require use namespace prefixes, non-XLink-based links legacy documents generally do not serve conforming XLink constructs stand, even attribute value defaulting used. example, XHTML element href attribute, attribute local attached element XHTML namespace, not same xlink:href global attribute XLinknamespace. specification XLink markup, combinations XLink attributes arrangements elements XLink attributes are conformant. also XLink semantics such conformant markup. XLink used elements have other attributes related elements linking semantics, XLink not not attempt define semantics such combinations. element such possibly conflicting markup occur, specify semantics result. XLink Elements Attributes XLink offers kinds links: Extended links Extended links offer full XLink functionality, such inbound third-party arcs, well links have arbitrary numbers participating resources. result, structure be fairly complex, including elements pointing remote resources, elements containing local resources, elements specifying arc traversal rules, elements specifying human-readable resource arc titles. XLink way give extended link special semantics finding linkbases; used fashion, extended link XLink application process other links. Simple links Simple links offer shorthand syntax common kind link, outbound link exactly participating resources category HTML-style IMG links fall). simple links offer less functionality extended links, have special internal structure. simple links are conceptually subset extended links, are syntactically different. example, convert simple link extended link, several structural changes be needed. following sections define XLink elements attributes. Extended Links Element) extended link link associates arbitrary number resources. participating resources be combination remote local.] only kind link able have inbound third-party arcs extended link. Typically, extended linking elements are stored separately resources associate example, entirely different documents). Thus, extended links are important situations participating resources are read-only, expensive modify update inexpensive modify update separate linking element, resources are formats nativesupport embedded links many multimedia formats). following diagram shows extended link associates remote resources. represent, example, information student's course load: resource being description student, being description student's academic advisor, resources representing courses student attending, last resource representing course student auditing. extended link, resources be entirely unrelated; example, be separate documents. lines emanating extended link represent association resources. However, notice lines do not have directionality. Directionality expressed traversal rules; such rules being provided, resources are associated particular order, implication individual resources are accessed. following diagram shows extended link associates remote resources local resource special element extended link element). represent same sort course-load example described above, addition student's grade point average stored locally. Again, lines represent mere association resources, traversal directions behaviors implied. XLink element type extended links element attribute XLink namespace called type value extended-type element contain mixture following elements order, possibly other content markup: locator-type elements address remote resources participating link arc-type elements provide traversal rules link's participating resources title-type elements provide human-readable labels link resource-type elements supply local resources participate link not error extended-type element associate fewer resources. link only participating resource, none simply untraversable. Such link still be useful, example, associate properties single resource means XLink attributes, provide placeholder link information be populated eventually. Subelements simple extended type anywhere parent extended-type element are not conformant. Subelements locator, arc, resource type are not direct children extended-type element are not conformant. extended-type element have semantic attributes role title Semantic Attributes arcrole, title)). supply semantic information link whole; role attribute property entire link title attribute human-readable description entire link. notconformant other XLink attributes be present element. title attribute more title-type elements are present, have XLink-specified relationship; higher-level application built XLink likely want specify appropriate treatment example, precedence) case.

Linkbases be chained virtue serving starting resource yet linkbase arc. application interpreting initial linkbase arc choose limit number steps processed chain. application maintain list extended links retrieved result processing linkbase, not retrieve duplicate resources links case cyclic dependency ease XLink processing, document creators wish define linkbase arcs beginning document. Example: Annotating Specification Following non-normative set declarations extended link providing linkbase arcs: <!ELEMENT basesloaded basesloaded xlink:type #FIXED startrsrc EMPTY><!ATTLIST startrsrc xlink:type #FIXED xlink:href CDATA #REQUIRED xlink:label NMTOKEN #IMPLIED><!ELEMENT linkbase EMPTY><!ATTLIST linkbase xlink:type #FIXED xlink:href CDATA #REQUIRED xlink:label NMTOKEN #IMPLIED><!ELEMENT load EMPTY><!ATTLIST load xlink:type #FIXED xlink:arcrole CDATA #FIXED xlink:actuate #IMPLIED xlink:from NMTOKEN #IMPLIED xlink:to NMTOKEN #IMPLIED> Following XML element using declarations look. indicate specification document loaded, linkbase full annotations automatically be loaded well, possibly necessitating re-rendering entire specification document reveal regions serve starting resources links found linkbase. <basesloaded> <startrsrc xlink:label="spec" xlink:href="spec.xml" <linkbase xlink:label="linkbase" xlink:href="linkbase.xml" <load xlink:from="spec" xlink:to="linkbase" actuate="onLoad" Following XML element using declarations look linkbase loading were request. time, starting resource words here reveal annotations." starting resource were entire document example above, reasonable behavior allowing user actuate traversal be confirmation dialog box. <basesloaded> <startrsrc xlink:label="spec" xlink:href="spec.xml#string-range(//*,'Click here reveal annotations.')" <linkbase xlink:label="linkbase" xlink:href="linkbase.xml" <load xlink:from="spec" xlink:to="linkbase" actuate="onRequest" Simple Links Element) simple link link associates exactly resources, local remote, arc going former latter. Thus, simple link always outbound link.] purpose simple link be convenient shorthand equivalent extended link. single simple linking element combines basic functions extended-type element, locator-type element, arc-type element, resource-type element. following diagram shows characteristics simple link; associates local remote resource, implicitly single traversal arc local resource remote represent, example, name student appearing text clicked, leads information student. Example: Simple Link Functionality Done Extended Link simple link be represented extended link approximately following way: <studentlink xlink:type="extended"> <resource xlink:type="resource" xlink:label="local">Pat Jones</resource> <locator xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="..." xlink:label="remote" xlink:role="..." xlink:title="..." <go xlink:type="arc" xlink:from="local" xlink:to="remote" xlink:arcrole="..." xlink:show="..." xlink:actuate="..." simple link combines features types labels) single element. cases only subset features required, XLink simple linking element available alternative extended linking element. features missing simple links are Supplying arbitrary numbers local remote resources Specifying arc remote resource local resource Associating title single hardwired arc Associating role title local resource Associating role title link whole XLink element simple links element: attribute XLink namespace called type value attribute XLink namespace called href attribute XLink namespace called type. case, value implied type attribute. other words, XLink type attribute optional XLink simple links. simple equivalent extended link be <studentlink xlink:href="...">Pat Jones</studentlink> simple-type element have content. simple-type element together content, local resource link, element were resource-type element. simple-type element nested XLink elements, such contained elements have XLink-specified relationship parent link. possible simple-type element have content; incases link expected be traversed request, interactive XLink applications typically generate content order give user way initiate traversal. simple-type element effectively locator attribute href semantic attributes role title locator-type element, behavior attributes show actuate single semantic attribute arcrole arc-type element. not error simple-type element have locator attribute value. value not provided, link simply untraversable.
