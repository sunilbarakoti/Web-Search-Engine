EmotionML provides mechanisms to represent emotions interms of scientifically valid descriptors: categories, dimensions, appraisals,and action tendencies. Given the lack of agreement in the community, EmotionMLdoes not provide a single vocabulary of emotion terms, but gives users a choiceto select the most suitable emotion vocabulary in their annotations. In orderto promote interoperability, publicly defined vocabularies should be used wherepossible and reasonable from the point of view of the target application. Thepresent document provides a number of emotion vocabularies that can be used forthis purpose. Status of this document This section describes the status of this document at the time of itspublication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3Cpublications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found inthe W3C technical reports index athttp://www.w3.org/TR/. This is the 1 April 2014 W3C Working Group Note of"Vocabularies for EmotionML". This document represents an important complement to the Emotion MarkupLanguage specification [EmotionML], i.e., a publiccollection of emotion vocabularies that can be used with EmotionML. It wasoriginally part of an earlier draft of the EmotionML specification, but wasmoved out of it because of the quasi-static nature of Recommendation Trackdocuments. Publishing the vocabularies as a separate document allows us toprovide updates, extensions and corrections of the list of vocabularies asrequired, without having to follow the multiple steps involved in releasing anew version of a Recommendation. The present document serves as a repository of emotion vocabulariesin both human-readable and machine-readable form. Even though its first version waspublished as a Working Draft, the document status has been changed to W3CWorking Group Note to allow for occasional updates without raising theexpectation of progressing towards a normative Recommendation. Since the workdescribed here reflects an evolving state of the art on Emotion vocabularies,the Working Group believes it is premature to propose a normativeRecommendation on Vocabularies at this time. The main differences from the previous version are: adding the version information in the computer-readable definition of emotion vocabularies changing the file extension of the computer-readabledefinition of emotion vocabularies from ".xml" to ".emotionml"based on the definition inthe EmotionMLspecification The following editorial changes are also made: updating the reference to the EmotionML specification with its Proposed Recommendation in Section 6.1 updating the link to Ekman's "Universals and Cultural Differences in Facial Expressions of Emotion" in Section 6.2 Any future updates to this Note will respect the repository-typenature of this document, as described in Section1.1. This W3C Working GroupNote has been developed by the MultimodalInteraction Working Group of the W3C Multimodal InteractionActivity. It represents consensus in the group's EmotionML subgroup. Thegroup is likely to produce new versions of this document, but will strive tomaintain syntactic compatibility with the current version. In particular theXML identifiers of vocabularies and the items in each vocabulary can beexpected to remain valid with future versions of this Note. It is expected thatany updates to this document will mostly add new vocabularies, or addexplanations to existing vocabularies and/or vocabulary items. Comments for this note are welcomed and should have a subject starting withthe prefix '[emotion-voc]'.

EmotionML provides mechanisms to represent emotions in terms ofscientifically valid descriptors: categories, dimensions, appraisals, andaction tendencies. Given the lack of agreement in the community, EmotionML doesnot provide a single vocabulary of emotion terms, but gives users a choice toselect the most suitable emotion vocabulary in their annotations. In order topromote interoperability, publicly defined vocabularies should be used wherepossible and reasonable from the point of view of the target application. Thepresent document provides a number of emotion vocabularies that can be used forthis purpose. The guiding principle for selecting emotion vocabularies for inclusion inthis document has been to list vocabularies that are either: commonly used in technological contexts, or represent current emotion models from the scientific literature. In addition, given the difficulty to define mappings between emotioncategories, dimensions, appraisals and action tendencies, we have includedpairs or groups of vocabularies where these mappings are rather well defined.Future versions of EmotionML can use these vocabularies as a starting point todefine mappings between different emotion descriptions. The selection of emotion vocabularies in this document is necessarilyincomplete; users are likely to find emotion vocabularies to be missing. Thereare two ways how a user can address this situation. First, users can easilywrite a definition for a custom emotion vocabulary as described in theEmotionML specification's section on Defining vocabularies. Secondly,feedback on the selection of emotion vocabularies in this document is highlyappreciated. Future versions of this document can include corrections and morethorough explanations for the existing vocabularies, and add additionalvocabularies which may be of interest to a wider audience. Please send commentsto www-multimodal@w3.org (with publicarchive). 1.1 Repository nature of this document The present document serves as a repository of emotion vocabulariesin both human-readable and machine-readable form. Any future updates to thisNote will respect the repository-type nature of this document, bymaintaining backward-compatibility as follows: all future updates will retain all existing names of vocabularies and of existing vocabulary items; new vocabularies may added under new names, and new items may be added to existing vocabularies; new metadata may be added to vocabularies and items, in order to specify in more detail the intended meaning and properties of the vocabularies and items as defined in the present documents and in the original literature from which the vocabularies were extracted. Should any corrections to existing vocabularies be required which wouldbreak the above-mentioned backward-compatibility rules, the correctedvocabulary will be published under a new name alongside the original,uncorrected vocabulary. 1.2 Use of undated URIs to refer to vocabularies in thisdocument Given the repository nature of the document, references to the vocabulariesshould use the undated "Latest Version" URI of this document to refer toemotion vocabularies, as shown in the examples below, and not the dated "ThisVersion" URI. This promotes interoperability. Furthermore, it makes it possiblefor older documents to automatically benefit from updates to the repository,such as new metadata being added to existing vocabularies. Since documentsalways refer to the latest, compatible version of a vocabulary via the "LatestVersion" URI, it becomes possible to process older documents in terms of thenewest metadata without having to update the documents. 2 Emotion category vocabularies This section provides vocabularies for use with the EmotionML <category>element. 2.1 Ekman's "big six" basic emotions These six terms are proposed by Paul Ekman (Ekman,1972, p. 251-252) as basic emotions with universal facial expressions --emotions that are recognized and produced in all human cultures. Term Remarks anger disgust fear happiness sadness surprise The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#big6">    <category name="anger"/></emotion> 2.2 Everyday emotion vocabulary These 17 terms are the result of a study by Cowie et al. (Cowie et al., 1999) investigating emotions thatfrequently occur in everyday life. Term Remarks affectionate afraid amused angry bored confident content disappointed excited happy interested loving pleased relaxed sad satisfied worried The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#everyday-categories">    <category name="affectionate"/></emotion> 2.3 OCC categories The 22 OCC categories are proposed by Ortony, Clore and Collins (Ortony et al., 1988, p. 19) as part of theirappraisal model. See also OCC appraisalsbelow. Term Remarks admiration anger disappointment distress fear fears-confirmed gloating gratification gratitude happy-for hate hope joy love pity pride relief remorse reproach resentment satisfaction shame The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#occ-categories">    <category name="admiration"/></emotion> 2.4 FSRE categories The 24 FSRE categories are used in the study by Fontaine, Scherer, Roeschand Ellsworth (Fontaine et al., 2007, p. 1055)investigating the dimensionality of emotion space. See also FSRE dimensions below. Term Remarks anger anxiety being hurt compassion contempt contentment despair disappointment disgust fear guilt happiness hate interest irritation jealousy joy love pleasure pride sadness shame stress surprise The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#fsre-categories">    <category name="anger"/></emotion> 2.5 Frijda's categories This category set is included because according to Nico Frijda's proposal ofaction tendencies (Frijda, 1986), thesecategories are related to action tendencies. See Frijda's action tendencies, below. Term Remarks anger related to action tendency 'agonistic' arrogance related to action tendency 'approach' desire related to action tendency 'approach' disgust related to action tendency 'rejecting' enjoyment related to action tendency 'being-with' fear related to action tendency 'avoidance' humility related to action tendency 'submitting' indifference related to action tendency 'nonattending' interest related to action tendency 'attending' resignation related to action tendency 'submitting' shock related to action tendency 'interrupting' surprise related to action tendency 'interrupting' The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#frijda-categories">    <category name="anger"/></emotion> 3 Emotion dimension vocabularies This section provides vocabularies for use with the EmotionML <dimension>element. 3.1 Mehrabian's PAD dimensions Mehrabian proposed a three-dimensional description of emotion in terms ofPleasure, Arousal, and Dominance (PAD; Mehrabian,1996, p. 264). Term Remarks pleasure arousal dominance The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion dimension-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#pad-dimensions">    <dimension name="pleasure" value="0.5"/></emotion> 3.2 FSRE dimensions The four emotion dimensions obtained in the study by Fontaine, Scherer,Roesch and Ellsworth (Fontaine et al., 2007, p.1051 and 1055) investigating the dimensionality of emotion space. See also FSRE categories above. Term Remarks valence also named evaluation or pleasantness potency also named control arousal also named activation unpredictability The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion dimension-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#fsre-dimensions">    <dimension name="valence" value="0.5"/></emotion> 3.3 The intensity dimension Sometimes it is necessary to represent the mere fact that an emotion of someundefined nature is present with a certain intensity. This can be achievedusing the dimension vocabulary consisting of the single dimension"intensity". Term Remarks intensity the intensity of the (unidentified) emotion that is considered to be present The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion dimension-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#intensity-dimension">    <dimension name="intensity" value="0.5"/></emotion> 4 Appraisal vocabularies This section provides vocabularies for use with the EmotionML <appraisal>element. 4.1 OCC appraisals The following appraisals were proposed by Ortony, Clore and Collins (Ortony et al., 1988) in their appraisal model. Seealso OCC categories above. Term Remarks desirability relevant for event based emotions. (pleased/displeased) praiseworthiness relevant for attribution emotions. (approving/disapproving) appealingness relevant for attraction emotions. (liking/disliking) desirability-for-other related to fortunes of others. Whether the event is desirable for the other. deservingness related to fortunes of others. Whether the other â€œdeservesâ€? the event. liking related to fortunes of others. Whether the other is liked or not. These distinguish between: happy-for, pity, gloating (schadenfreude), and resentment. likelihood relevant for prospect emotions. (hope/fear) effort relevant for prospect emotions. How much effort the individual invested in the outcome. realization relevant for prospect emotions. The actual resulting outcome. These distinguish between: relief, disappointment, satisfaction, and fears-confirmed. strength-of-identification relevant for attribution emotions. The stronger one identifies with the other, that distinguishes between whether pride or admiration is felt. expectation-of-deviation relevant for attribution emotions. Distinguishes whether the other is expected to act in the manner deserving of admiration or reproach. These distinguish b between: pride, shame, admiration, reproach. familiarity relevant for attraction emotions. (love/hate) The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion appraisal-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#occ-appraisals">    <appraisal name="suddenness" value="0.5"/></emotion> 4.2 Scherer's appraisals The following list of appraisals was proposed by Klaus Scherer as a sequenceof Stimulus Evaluation Checks (SECs) in his Component Process Model of emotion(Scherer, 1984, p. 310; Scherer, 1999, p. 639). Term Remarks Novelty suddenness familiarity predictability Intrinsic pleasantness intrinsic-pleasantness Goal significance relevance-person Relevance to the concerns of the person him- or herself, e.g. survival, bodily integrity, fulfillment of basic needs, self-esteem relevance-relationship Relevance to concerns regarding relationships with others, e.g. establishment, continued existence and intactness of relationships, cohesion of social groups relevance-social-order Relevance to social order, e.g. sense of orderliness, predictability in a social environment including fairness & appropriateness outcome-probability consonant-with-expectation goal-conduciveness urgency Coping potential agent-self The event was caused by the agent him- or herself agent-other The event was caused by another person agent-nature The event was caused by chance or by nature cause-intentional 0: caused by negligence, 1: caused intentionally control Is the event controllable? power Power of the agent him- or herself adjustment-possible Is adjustment possible to the agent's own goals? Compatibility with standards norm-compatibility Compatibility with external standards, such as norms or demands of a reference group self-compatibility Compatibility with internal standards, such as the self ideal or internalized moral code The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion appraisal-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#scherer-appraisals">    <appraisal name="suddenness" value="0.5"/></emotion> 4.3 EMA appraisals The following list of appraisals was compiled by Gratch and Marsella (Gratch & Marsella, 2004) for their EMAmodel. Term Remarks relevance desirability agency causal attribution -- who caused the event? blame blame and credit -- part of causal attribution likelihood unexpectedness urgency ego-involvement controllability part of coping potential changeability part of coping potential power part of coping potential adaptability part of coping potential The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion appraisal-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#ema-appraisals">    <appraisal name="relevance" value="0.5"/></emotion> 5 Action tendency vocabularies This section provides vocabularies for use with the EmotionML <action-tendency>element. 5.1 Frijda's action tendencies This set of action tendencies was proposed by Nico Frijda (Frijda, 1986), who also coined the term 'actiontendency'. See also Frijda's category set,above. Term Remarks approach aimed towards access and consummatory activity, related to desire avoidance aimed towards own inaccessibility and protection, related to fear being-with aimed at contact and interaction, related to enjoyment attending aimed at identification, related to interest rejecting aimed at removal of object, related to disgust nonattending aimed at selecting, related to indifference agonistic aimed at removal of obstruction and regaining control, related to anger interrupting aimed at reorientation, related to shock and surprise dominating aimed at retained control, related to arrogance submitting aimed at deflecting pressure, related to humility and resignation The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can beused in EmotionML as indicated in the following example. <emotion action-tendency-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#frijda-action-tendencies">    <action-tendency name="approach"/></emotion> 6 References 6.1 Technical references EmotionML Emotion Markup Language (EmotionML) 1.0, F.
