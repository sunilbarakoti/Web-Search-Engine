Task models provide a goal-oriented description of interactivesystems suitable for reviewing temporal relationships betweentasks, and their decomposition into subtasks, but avoiding the needfor the level of detail required for a full description of the userinterface. This makes it easier to talk through a user interfacedesign without getting distracted by the details. Each task describes an activity that has to be carried out tofulfil the user's goals. Tasks can be represented at variousabstraction levels. When designers only want to specifyrequirements on how activities should be carried out, they justneed to consider the main high-level tasks. On the other hand, whendesigners aim to provide more precise design indications, then theactivities are represented at a finer granularity, for example,covering the temporal sequence of tasks to be carried out by theuser or system, as well as any preconditions for each task. The purpose of this document is to define a standard forinterchange of task models, based on the widely adoptedConcurTaskTrees (CTT) notation. CTT is a visual notation for describing task models. Here is anexample for the task of reserving a hotel room: Figure 1. Example of a Task Model in theCTT Notation This specification defines a meta-model and XML schema forinterchange of task models based on the CTT notation, but does notnormatively define how such models should be visualized. Specific requirements for task meta-model In this section there are some requirements that have beenspecifically identified for task models. Req1: Separation of static aspects from dynamic aspects Req2: Separation of the hierarchical structure from otheraspects Req3: Possibility of relating task performance to the contextof use (even if modelling the context of use is not in the scope ofthis document) Req4: Provide an initial taxonomy of task types (optionalusage) The requirements are not normative, and rather intended to give thereader a sense of the assumptions that underlay the notation. Meta-Model This section defines a normative meta-model for the task model notation. Tasks have ahierarchical structure and use the set of temporal operators todescribe the relations between them, which are based on those usedin CTT. Operators The operators include both N-ary operators and 1-ary operators.They are described in the following list: Interleaving (T1 ||| T2||| â€¦ TN): The connected tasks can be performedconcurrently, without any specific constraint. Order independence(T1|=|T2 |=| â€¦ TN): the tasks canbe performed in any order; Synchronisation(T1|[]|T2 |[]| â€¦ TN): The tasksare concurrent and can exchange information among them; Parallelism (T1||T2 || â€¦TN): The tasks are performed in true paralllelism. Choice (T1[]T2[] â€¦TN): in this case it is possible to choose one task froma set of tasks and, once the choice has been made, the chosen taskcan be performed Disabling(T1[>T2[> â€¦ TN): theleft-hand task is deactivated once the right-hand task hasstarted; Suspend-Resume (T1 |>T2|> â€¦ TN): The right-hand task interruptsthe left-hand task one. When it is finished, the left-hand task canbe reactivated from the state it was before the interruption. Enabling(T1>>T2>> â€¦ TN): Thereare two cases: without information passing - when T1completes it enables T2, when T2 completes itenables T3, and so forth through TN with information passing, as before, exceptinformation is passed from each completed task to the nexttask Iteration (T*): the task is performediteratively: when it terminates, its execution is started againfrom the beginning. Optional ([T]): the task is optionallyperformed. A comparison of which operators are supported in different taskmodelling languages is given in Table 1. The temporal operators areall N-ary except iteration and optionality, which are both unary.The N-ary operator relationship is associated to 2..N subtasks tomodel that N-ary operators are associated to the decomposition of atask into its subtasks. The N-ary operators are associative andcommutative except for disabling, suspend-resume, and enabling,which are associative but not commutative. It is also worth pointing out that the operators have different priorities.For N-ary operators the priority associated to each operator isexpressed by the order in which it appears in the UML class diagramin Figure 2 (e.g. the choice is the operatorwhich has the highest priority). Another key concept (inherited from the CTT notation) is task allocation: how eachtask is to be carried out is indicated by the related category andis explicitly represented using different subclasses for eachcategory. There are four possibilities: Task Categories user task â€” an internal cognitive activity,such as selecting a strategy to solve a problem system task â€” performed by the applicationitself, such as generating the results of a query interaction task â€” user actions that mayresult in immediate system feedback, such as editing a diagram abstract task â€” a task that has subtasksbelonging to different categories, and thus cannot be allocateduniquely using the previous three categories Task Types Designers can also classify tasks according to their semantics,i.e. by giving each task a type. It is important to notethat each of the above categories has its own predefined set oftask types, thus such sets of predefined task types are indicatedseparately in the class diagram, as defined below: System Tasks Comparison â€” the system provides information that is useful forcomparing pieces of information GenerateAlerts â€” the system generates an alert Feedback â€” the system provides feedback about some intensivecomputational activity Grouping â€” the system provides pieces of information that aresomehow grouped Locate â€” the system provides information useful to locatesomething Overview â€” the system provides an overview of some data Interaction Tasks Single Selection â€” the user interacts with the system to selectone piece of information Multiple Selection â€” the user interacts with the system toselect multiple pieces of information Edit â€” the user interacts with the system to change some pieceof information Control â€” the user interacts with the system to trigger somefunctionality Zooming â€” the user interacts with the system to change thelevel of detail presented, e.g. zooming on a map or photograph Filtering â€” the user interacts with the system to filter howsome data is visualised, e.g. to show some aspects and to hideothers DetailOnDemand â€” the user interacts with the system to ask forsome detail on some item User Tasks ProblemSolving â€” the user performs a cognitive activity tosolve a problem Comparing â€” the user performs a cognitive activity to comparepieces of information Planning â€” the user performs some activity to plan what todo Abstract Tasks Search Information â€” the user performs an iterative search fora piece of information Additional task types may be used for added flexibility. Inorder to model this, each task category has two attributes:predef_type, which contains the task type when itis included in the predefined set of tasks already identified;ext_type, which contains the task type in case anew task type has to be defined. Additional Task Properties It is possible to specify additional information associated witheach task through a number of attributes. For instance, it ispossible to specify the context of use that supports the taskconcerned, if there are tasks that are meaningful only for somecontexts of use. Modelling the context of use is out of the scopeof this document. In addition, for each task it is possible to specify the domainobjects that are manipulated by the task, and whether they areread-only or can be updated. Task Meta Model in UML Figure 2 shows the class diagramrepresenting the task meta-model. A task model is composed of a setof tasks; a subtask relation is defined among them, and N-aryoperators are associated with the 2..N subtasks of a task. Figure 2. Main Aspects of the TaskMeta-model Each task can be associated with one or multiple domain objectsthat it can manipulate. In addition, each task has a number ofproperties/attributes: an identifier, the context of use(indicating what contexts are suitable for its performance),informal description, and so forth. Moreover, since the execution of a task is often subject to theavailability of a given resource or depends on the value of acertain variable, in order to express such dependencies, thelanguage contains the Precondition and Postcondition classes(pre-conditions indicate what must be true before the task iscarried out, while post-conditions indicate what will be true aftertask execution). A precondition (which can occur or not as associated to acertain task, see related multiplicity 0..1 in Figure 2) is an instance of the ConditionGroup class.It returns a Boolean value, which is obtained by applying thelogical operators to the operands. An operand is aConditionLiteral, which can be used to represent values. It can beeither a constant or a variable manipulated during the taskexecution. In the former case, the value is expressed by the valueattribute of the ValueLiteral subclass, in the latter it isexpressed by the DomainObjectLiteral class, which represents areference to a domain object manipulated by the task itself. Anoperand can also be represented in turn by a ConditionGroup, inorder to create complex Boolean expressions. The operators expressthe Boolean relation between the operands. An operator can be oneof the following: and, or, xor, contains, stars, ends, greaterthan, greater than or equals to, less than, less than or equals to,equals to, not equals. This hierarchical structure of preconditionsallows the representation of complex conditions. The same structure is also possible for specifyingpostconditions associated to the tasks. The following is the list of classes contained in Figure 2. Class: Task Composition from: Task, to:Task, associated with N-aryOperator Association: Domain Object(cardinality: minimum zero, maximum unbounded) Association: ConditionGroup (name:precondition, cardinality minimum zero, maximum one) Association: ConditionGroup (name:postcondition, cardinality minimum zero, maximum one) Association: 1-aryOperator (cardinalityminimum zero, maximum two) Attribute: Identifier (String) Attribute: Name (String) Attribute: Frequency (String) Attribute: ContextOfUse (String) Attribute: Description(String) Class: User Superclass: Task Attribute: predef_type (Enum) Attribute: ext_type (String) Class: Abstract Superclass: Task Attribute: predef_type (Enum) Attribute: ext_type (String) Class: System Superclass: Task Attribute: predef_type (Enum) Attribute: ext_type (String) Class: Interaction Superclass: Task Attribute: predef_type (Enum) Attribute: ext_type (String) Class: DomainObject Enumeration Class: N-aryOperator Association: Composition SubTask(cardinality role Task: minimum zero, maximum one ; cardinalityrole SubTask: minimum zero or two, maximum N) Constant: choice Constant: order_independence Constant: Interleaving Constant: parallelism Constant: synchronisation Constant: disabling Constant: suspend_resume Constant: enabling Enumeration Class: 1-aryOperator Association: Task (cardinality: 1) Constant: optional Constant: iterative Class: ConditionGroup Aggregation from: ConditionGroup toConditionGroup: (name: operand) Aggregation from: ConditionLiteral toConditionGroup: (name: operand) Association: LogicOperator (name:operator, cardinality: 1) Association: Task(name: precondition, cardinality: one) Association: Task(name: postcondition, cardinality: one) Class: ConditionLiteral Aggregation from: ConditionLiteral toConditionGroup: (name: operand) Class: ValueLiteral Superclass: ConditionLiteral Attribute: value (String) Class:DomainObjectLiteral Superclass: ConditionLiteral Attribute: domain_object (String) Class: LogicOperator Association: ConditionGroup (name:operator, cardinality 1) Examples The example below (see Figure 3) has beentaken from the SERENOA Project. It is about a case study on a carrental service, which the user can access in order to reserve acar. To this goal, users have to specify a number ofcharacteristics they are searching for about the car, alsoproviding some other information about themselves (name, surname,address, city..). Then, the user can submit the request and theservice responds with the list of results. In the following, we will specify the task model as a nestedlist of tasks, where nesting is used to model the hierarchy betweenparent and children. In addition, for each task we will specify -inbrackets beside its name- the relationship(s) in which theconcerned task is involved. Please also note that in this example all the tasks areinteractive apart two tasks -Access Service and Show results- whichare application tasks: the first (Access service) models the systemtask access the service for doing the search with the parametersprovided by the user; the second one is the system task that is incharge of showing the results to the user.

The Task element contains all the sub elements and attributesfor the specification of a task. Such element contains thefollowing elements: Description: a human-readable task description Precondition: a structured precondition on the taskexecution Postcondition: a structured postcondition on the taskexecution UnaryOperatorGroup: the unary operators associated with thetask (Iterative: if the task is iterative;Optional: if the task isoptional) N-aryOperatorGroup: the list of sub-tasks (if any), enclosed bya tag representing the n-ary operator that connects them ContextOfUse: the suitable context for carrying out thetask DomainObject: the list of objects manipulated by the currenttask In addition, it contains the following attributes: Identifier: a unique task identifier Name: a human readable task name Frequency: the task execution frequency The N-aryOperatorGroup definition contains a choice amongelements representing a different n-ary temporal operator. Each oneof these elements contains the definition of a sub-task list(SubTask type). Such list is represented by a group that definesthe task category (User, System, Interaction, Abstract) and itstype, according to the class hierarchy defined by the metamodel. The possible task types have been indicated beforehand. The ConditionGroup complex type contains one of the followingelements: ConditionLiteral, which represents a literal value or object(represented as different elements) ConditionGroup, which represents an expression ofConditionLiterals or ConditionGroups (also mixed), as a list ofelements. It contains also the operator attribute that contains theboolean operator for the expression. The possible values for the N-ary temporal operators are thefollowing: Choice Interleaving OrderIndependence Synchronisation Disabling SuspendResume Enabling Parallelism The n-ary operators are repesented as tags that include theconnected sub-tasks. For instance, a sequence of three interactionsub-tasks is represented with a â€œEnablingâ€? tag that contains treeâ€œInteractionâ€? tags.
